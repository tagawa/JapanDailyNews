### Transcript

Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on June 9th, 2023. Evacuation orders have been issued in Shizuoka prefecture's Shimoda city and Minami-Izu town due to heavy rain and the risk of landslides. The region was hit hard by record-breaking rainfall last weekend, and even small amounts of rain could increase the risk of landslides. Meanwhile, a mother in Matsumoto, Nagano prefecture, has been arrested on suspicion of abandoning her 2-year-old son on a bed soaked in kerosene, resulting in his death. In other news, a person was hit by a train on the Sanyo Shinkansen line between Okayama and Hyogo prefectures, leading to a suspension of train services for over 5 hours and leaving over 400 passengers stranded. The train services have since resumed. Finally, weather forecasters are warning of the possibility of heavy rain in the Tokai and Kanto-Koshin regions due to the influence of a front and low-pressure system. And now for the weather. Today in Tokyo, it will be mostly cloudy with heavy rain throughout the day and temperatures ranging from 21 to 24 degrees Celsius.  And that's all for today's news. Thanks for listening to Japan Daily News.
