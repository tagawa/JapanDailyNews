Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on October 11th, 2023. In today's news, the fourth game of the 'Oza-sen' Shogi tournament, one of the eight major titles in Shogi, has begun in Kyoto. If the 21-year-old Shogi prodigy, Sota Fujii, wins this game, he will become the first player in history to hold all eight titles simultaneously.

Moving on to weather news, a powerful typhoon, Typhoon No. 15, is currently heading north over the southern waters of Japan and is expected to approach the Ogasawara Islands around the 13th of this month. The seas around the Ogasawara Islands may become very rough, so caution is advised against high waves.

In other news, in Okinawa, two out of three people who went missing during a cave exploration tour on Yonaguni Island have been found safe. The remaining male tourist is still missing, and the police have launched a search operation.

Turning our attention to Afghanistan, the earthquake-stricken areas where over 2,000 people have already lost their lives are now facing severe cold weather. The nighttime temperatures in some areas have dropped close to freezing, making the provision of temporary housing a pressing issue.

Shifting gears, the Tsukiji Fish Market, which relocated to Toyosu Market in the Koto Ward of Tokyo, celebrates its fifth anniversary today. While preparations for the opening of new commercial facilities in Toyosu Market are underway for next February, the redevelopment of the former Tsukiji Market site is expected to be decided by next March.

Moving on, let's talk about the Osaka-Kansai Expo, which will be held in two years. According to a recent NHK public opinion survey, 56% of respondents expressed dissatisfaction with the fact that the construction costs for the expo venue are expected to be nearly 1.8 times the initial plan, while only 29% found it acceptable.

Lastly, a tragic incident occurred in Tokyo's Higashimurayama City, where an elderly woman was hit by a car and dragged for approximately two kilometers, resulting in her death. The 53-year-old driver, who works for a company, has been arrested on suspicion of hit-and-run. During the investigation, the driver stated that he was not aware of hitting someone.
