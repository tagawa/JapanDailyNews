Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on September 8th, 2024. Today marks one year since the record-breaking heavy rain caused severe flooding in Chiba and Ibaraki Prefectures. Over 2000 homes were affected in Chiba, but recovery efforts are gradually progressing, with emergency repairs on residences completed last month. Meanwhile, in Hyogo Prefecture, Governor Saito is facing calls for resignation amid allegations of power harassment. The ruling Liberal Democratic Party is pushing for his resignation, and three other political factions are reportedly aligning with this demand. The situation is evolving as the fifth faction, the Japan Innovation Party, is expected to announce its stance soon. In a different context, one month has passed since the issuance of the Nankai Trough earthquake advisory. Some local governments in tsunami-prone areas experienced confusion in their response, but in Ikata, Ehime Prefecture, officials are now incorporating new evacuation strategies into their disaster plans. The Cabinet Office is also set to conduct a survey among local governments and businesses to improve communication regarding disaster preparedness. On the international stage, a transgender athlete from Italy made headlines at the Paris Paralympics, competing in the women's 200-meter race for visually impaired athletes. She emphasized that being born male should not be a reason for discrimination and advocated for equal rights for all. Lastly, Typhoon No. 11, which briefly intensified into a "super typhoon," made landfall in southern China on September 6, resulting in at least three fatalities and widespread damage from fallen trees and flooding. In domestic news, train services on the JR Shonan-Shinjuku Line and the JR Utsunomiya Line have resumed operations after disruptions caused by recent incidents. And now for the weather. Today in Tokyo, it will be sunny with a high of 32 degrees Celsius and a low of 28 degrees Celsius.  Visit JapanDailyNews.com for the news, yen exchange rates, and a daily Japanese proverb.
