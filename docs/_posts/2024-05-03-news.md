Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on May 3rd, 2024. In today's news, the Nuclear Regulation Authority has requested power companies to consider the possibility of rising ground in nuclear power plants and ensure the ability to pump seawater for cooling, following the significant uplift of the ground caused by the Noto Peninsula earthquake. The authorities will conduct training to confirm if seawater can be pumped up in case of unexpected ground uplift.

Moving on to our next story, the Tokyo Fire Department is urging thorough precautions against heatstroke as summer-like temperatures are forecasted to continue during the second half of the Golden Week holiday. Last week, there were cases of hikers experiencing symptoms of heatstroke and requiring helicopter rescue. The fire department advises acclimating to the heat and staying hydrated as essential measures.

In other news, in relation to the Tochigi body abandonment case, it has been revealed through interviews with investigative sources that the two suspects believed to be the mastermind and intermediary were in contact even after the discovery of the bodies. The police are investigating the details of the suspect's surrender and the communication that took place shortly before.

Moving on, the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court has identified the prolonged pre-trial procedures in criminal trials as a challenge. The Chief Justice expressed concern that the extended process could limit the memory of witnesses and emphasized the need for shared awareness among prosecutors and defense lawyers.

In arts-related news, a subsidiary organization of the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology has tightened the conditions for canceling grants for movies. This decision came after losing a lawsuit where the cancellation of a film grant was based on the actor's conviction. The organization has revised the conditions, now requiring specific risks that could harm public interest.

And finally, in Nanao, Ishikawa Prefecture, a company executive from Kobe has received a summary order of a 100,000 yen fine from the summary court. The executive was found to have provided a contract document with deficiencies regarding the cancellation terms when offering to install blue sheets on houses damaged by the Noto Peninsula earthquake.

That's all for today's news. Stay informed and have a great day! And now for the weather. Today in Tokyo, the weather will be mostly sunny with a high of 21°C and a low of 15°C. There is a 0% chance of rain and a UV index of 7.  Visit JapanDailyNews.com for the news, yen exchange rates, and a daily Japanese proverb.
