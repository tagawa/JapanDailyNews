Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on August 31st, 2024. In Gifu Prefecture, heavy rainfall has led to evacuation orders for 685 households, affecting 2049 residents in the Akasaka East area of Ogaki City. The water level of the Kuise River has surpassed flood danger levels, prompting authorities to issue a level four warning, urging everyone in the area to evacuate to safety. Meanwhile, Typhoon 10 is wreaking havoc across various regions, bringing unprecedented strong winds, high waves, and tidal surges. The Japan Meteorological Agency has warned of severe weather conditions, with the potential for heavy rainfall even in areas far from the typhoon's center. As the storm makes landfall in Kyushu and Shikoku, regions such as Hokkaido are also experiencing intense rainfall, raising the risk of disasters across the country. The agency continues to advise caution against landslides, flooding in low-lying areas, and river overflows. In a related note, transport services have been significantly affected due to Typhoon 10, disrupting Shinkansen and air travel, as well as highway operations. In political news, Hyogo Governor Saito is facing a no-confidence motion from a coalition of opposition parties amid allegations of power harassment. During testimony in a prefectural council investigation, Saito denied the accusations but expressed regret if his actions caused discomfort to anyone. The opposition coalition has decided to move forward with the no-confidence vote in the upcoming council session, citing difficulties in advancing prefectural governance under Saito's leadership. In another evacuation alert, Shiga Prefecture's Maibara City has issued warnings for the entire Ibuki area, affecting 126 households and 312 individuals due to the heightened risk of landslides from heavy rain. And now for the weather. Today in Tokyo, it will be partly cloudy with a high of 31 degrees Celsius and a low of 27 degrees Celsius, and there's a chance of patchy rain in the afternoon.
