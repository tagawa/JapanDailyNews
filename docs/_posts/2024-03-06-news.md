Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on March 6th, 2024. In today's news, the Tokyo Shinkansen has resumed service after a delay caused by an overrun incident at Fukushima's Koriyama Station. The Tohoku Shinkansen, which had been suspended, resumed operations around 9:50 am. Moving on to our next story, a fire broke out in a district in Kitakyushu known for its concentration of restaurants and eateries. Eight buildings, including several dining establishments, were engulfed in flames. Fortunately, there were no reported injuries. Now, let's turn our attention to transportation news. The JR Ome Line, which had suspended operations due to fallen trees caused by heavy snowfall, has now resumed service between Ome Station in Tokyo and Okutama Station in Okutama Town. In other weather-related news, heavy snowfall in the Kanto-Koshin region has caused disruptions in mountainous areas, leading to slip accidents and fallen trees. The Japan Meteorological Agency is urging caution for road conditions and the impact on transportation due to snow accumulation and icy roads. Shifting gears to traffic updates, the Chuo Expressway's upbound lanes between Kobuchizawa Interchange in Hokuto City, Yamanashi Prefecture, and Sugama Interchange have reopened. The closure was caused by an accident involving a large truck that slipped on the roadside slope. Snow is believed to be the cause, based on the driver's account. Snow removal operations were carried out at the scene, and the closure was lifted after 7 am. Next, in crowdfunding news, an NPO aiming to conduct trial flights for the 'Doctor Jet,' a small jet aircraft used to transport critically ill children to distant medical facilities, has announced that the funds raised through crowdfunding fell significantly short of the target. Despite this setback, the NPO plans to proceed with the trial flights as scheduled next month, although the number of transports will be limited. They are appealing for further donations. And finally, in crime news, three teenagers from Aichi and other areas have been arrested for committing a burglary in Wajima City, Ishikawa Prefecture, shortly after the Noto Peninsula earthquake. The suspects allegedly broke into a residence and stole items such as rings. With many people evacuating to shelters and other safe locations in the aftermath of the earthquake, the police suspect that the suspects took advantage of the post-earthquake chaos to commit the crime. Investigations are ongoing. That's all for today's news. Stay tuned for more updates from Japan Daily News. And now for the weather. Today in Tokyo, the weather will be mostly cloudy with a high of 7°C and a low of 2°C. There is a chance of light rain throughout the day.
