### Transcript

Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on May 31st, 2023. Early this morning, the Japanese government issued a J-Alert evacuation alert for Okinawa in response to a possible ballistic missile launched by North Korea. The missile was detected by radar but disappeared mid-flight, with some reports suggesting it may have fallen into the Yellow Sea. The alert was later lifted when it was determined that the missile was not a threat to Japan. In other news, the G7 held its first meeting to discuss the regulations and use of AI technology, aiming to establish rules for the spread of trustworthy AI. Meanwhile, a 29-year-old woman was found dead in Kumamoto, wrapped in cloth, and police are investigating whether she was involved in an incident after leaving her part-time job. Additionally, Typhoon No. 2 is expected to approach the Okinawa region with strong winds, high waves, and heavy rain, and there is a possibility of heavy rain in western and eastern Japan due to the effects of the front and the typhoon later this week. Finally, the Tokyo High Court ruled that the Tokyo Medical University's practice of deducting points from female applicants on the basis of their gender was discriminatory and ordered increased compensation for some of the plaintiffs. And now for the weather. Today in Tokyo, it will be partly cloudy with a high of 19°C (67°F) and a low of 17°C (63°F). There is a chance of light rain in the afternoon.  And that's all for today's news. Thanks for listening to Japan Daily News.
