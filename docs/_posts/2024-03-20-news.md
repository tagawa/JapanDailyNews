Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on March 20th, 2024. Today, we have several news stories from Japan.

First, train services on the JR Utsunomiya Line and Takasaki Line have been suspended in both directions due to a person-related incident at Urawa Station. As a result, trains between Tokyo Station and Utsunomiya Station, as well as between Tokyo Station and Takasaki Station, are currently not operating. JR East Japan plans to resume services around 10 a.m.

In other news, the methods to track evacuees outside of shelters have been determined in only 11 cities and wards in Tokyo's 23 special wards and Tama area. This issue has been a challenge during disasters, including the Noto Peninsula earthquake. A survey conducted by NHK revealed that only 11 cities and wards have established methods for identifying and confirming the safety of evacuees who are not in shelters.

Moving on, unstable atmospheric conditions are affecting western and eastern Japan, with strong winds and precipitation occurring in some areas. The Meteorological Agency is warning of heavy snowfall, particularly in mountainous regions, as well as gusty winds, high waves, and the possibility of thunderstorms and tornadoes. They are urging people to exercise caution.

In a developing story, a chemical machinery manufacturer in Yokohama is planning to file a criminal complaint against investigators involved in a wrongful arrest case. The company's president and two others were initially arrested on suspicion of illegal exports but were later found to be innocent. It is alleged that investigators from the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department intentionally destroyed statements from company executives during the investigation.

Next, a research group including Tokyo University has developed a new technology that utilizes microorganisms in the soil to strengthen the ground deep underground. They plan to conduct outdoor verification experiments by the end of the fiscal year and hope to apply the technology to prevent liquefaction caused by earthquakes in the future.

In global news, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) has reported that the average global temperature for the past year was the highest on record, surpassing the levels before the Industrial Revolution by more than 1.4 degrees Celsius.

Lastly, the National Institute of Infectious Diseases has announced the first confirmed case of human-to-human transmission of SFTS (Severe Fever with Thrombocytopenia Syndrome) through tick bites in Japan. The infection occurred in a doctor who had treated a patient with SFTS, but the doctor's symptoms have already improved.

That's all for today's news. Thank you for listening to Japan Daily News. Stay tuned for more updates. And now for the weather. Today in Tokyo, the weather will be sunny with a high of 14°C and a low of 6°C.  Visit JapanDailyNews.com for the news, yen exchange rates, and a daily Japanese proverb.
