Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on January 18th, 2024. In Fukushima's city of Soma, efforts are underway to recover the declining production of Aonori seaweed, which was once known as one of the leading Aonori production areas in the country. The fishing of Aonori seaweed is currently flourishing in the region.

Moving on to other news, Kyoto City has issued administrative guidance to a neurosurgery hospital following cases of inadequate surgical explanations and record-keeping, as well as insufficient safety management. The city's investigation revealed three such cases, prompting the hospital to be urged to make improvements.

Now, let's turn our attention to the impact of the Noto Peninsula earthquake on transportation. As of 7:00 a.m. today, the earthquake has affected railways, air travel, and roads in the region. The latest information from 5:00 a.m. indicates the extent of the impact.

Shifting gears, the Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry recently held an online meeting with representatives from economic organizations in the disaster-stricken areas to discuss support for the reconstruction of affected businesses. The representatives emphasized the need for assistance in repairing damaged buildings and maintaining employment for their employees.

In light of the ongoing water supply issues caused by the Noto Peninsula earthquake, the situation in Ishikawa Prefecture continues to be monitored and updated. The latest information on water supply can be found on the respective local government websites.

Turning to intellectual property matters, the Agency for Cultural Affairs in Japan has announced plans to seek public comments on a draft document titled 'AI and Copyright Perspectives.' The document addresses concerns about copyright infringement associated with the development and use of AI, and the public comment period will be conducted throughout January.

Lastly, in the wake of the Noto Peninsula earthquake, the Japan Meteorological Agency has issued a warning regarding rain in the affected areas. Due to the loosening of the ground caused by the earthquake, even a small amount of rain increases the risk of landslides and hypothermia. Vigilance is crucial in these circumstances. And now for the weather. Today in Tokyo, the weather will be partly cloudy with a maximum temperature of 12 degrees Celsius and a minimum temperature of 6 degrees Celsius.
