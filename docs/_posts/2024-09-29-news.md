Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on September 29th, 2024. In a significant development today, the giant pandas, 'Lili' and 'Shinshin', have departed from Ueno Zoo in Tokyo, heading back to their homeland in China. This move marks a poignant moment for the zoo and its visitors, as these beloved animals have been a major attraction for years. Their journey back reflects ongoing efforts to strengthen conservation ties between Japan and China.

Meanwhile, in Ishikawa Prefecture, a new support organization has been established by individuals from the Noto Peninsula region. This initiative aims to assist areas affected by the recent heavy rains, which have compounded the recovery challenges following the Noto Peninsula earthquake earlier this year. The group is actively engaging with local needs to provide effective support and facilitate necessary resources for the affected communities.

In Okinawa, authorities are preparing for the disposal of unexploded ordnance from World War II, with a significant operation scheduled in a residential area of Naha today. Approximately 1,400 residents have been advised to evacuate temporarily to ensure safety during this crucial operation. The remnants of war continue to pose risks, and this effort highlights the ongoing challenges faced by local communities.

In Fukushima, the town of Futaba held a spectacular fireworks display last night, launching 10,000 fireworks into the night sky. This event was organized to symbolize hope and resilience in the wake of the devastation caused by the Great East Japan Earthquake and the subsequent nuclear disaster. The vibrant display served as a reminder of the community's commitment to recovery and rebuilding.

In the realm of marketing, a recent survey revealed that since the regulation of stealth marketing, about 70 percent of influencers have noticed a decrease in requests for such posts. However, around 20 percent still reported receiving requests, indicating that while progress has been made, challenges persist in fully eradicating this practice from the industry.

Lastly, experts are emphasizing the importance of mental health care for those affected by the recent record rainfall in Ishikawa. Following the double disaster of the earthquake and subsequent flooding, many individuals are grappling with heightened stress levels. Professor Masaharu Maeda from Fukushima Medical University has underscored the necessity for proactive mental health support, noting that the psychological impact of these events can be significantly amplified. And now for the weather. Today in Tokyo, expect overcast skies with a high of 24 degrees Celsius and a low of 22 degrees, along with a chance of patchy rain.
