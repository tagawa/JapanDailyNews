The Tokyo Metropolitan Board of Education issued a notice to schools to caution students against copying AI-generated homework answers during summer vacation. In the case of the shooting incident at a Ground Self-Defense Force shooting range in Gifu, it has been revealed that the suspect discharged four bullets one at a time, and the authorities are investigating the details of the incident.
