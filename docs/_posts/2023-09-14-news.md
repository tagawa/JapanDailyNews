### Transcript

Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on September 14th, 2023. In today's news, a severe weather alert has been issued in Nagasaki Prefecture as a result of a long band of precipitation known as the 'line-shaped rainband.' Due to the influence of a front and moist air, the atmospheric conditions in northern Kyushu, particularly in Nagasaki Prefecture, have become extremely unstable, leading to the development of consecutive thunderstorm clouds. The Japan Meteorological Agency has warned of the possibility of heavy rain accompanied by thunderstorms in northern Kyushu late on the night of the 14th. They have urged caution against landslides, flooding in low-lying areas, and rising river levels, as well as the potential for intense gusts of wind such as lightning strikes and tornadoes.

In Saga Prefecture, the city of Karatsu has issued an evacuation advisory for a total of 6,245 households and 14,956 people in the Hizen, Chinzei, and Yobuko districts due to the issuance of a landslide warning as a result of heavy rain. This advisory corresponds to level 3, out of a 5-level heavy rain alert system, and is specifically aimed at urging the elderly and physically disabled individuals to begin evacuating.

Moving on to international news, the Ministry of Defense has announced that the Chinese aircraft carrier 'Shandong' has been confirmed to be sailing through the Pacific Ocean south of Okinawa, with the landing and takeoff of fighter jets observed. This is the second time that the presence of this aircraft carrier sailing through the Pacific has been confirmed, and the Ministry of Defense continues to exercise caution and surveillance.

In Fukushima, the Cultural Affairs Agency has decided to conduct an on-site investigation of the national treasure 'Hakusui Amida Hall,' which suffered flooding damage due to the record-breaking heavy rain on September 8th. The agency will assess the extent of the damage and consider the need for restoration work.

In Saitama, a tragic accident occurred at a nursing care facility on the 13th, where two individuals in their 80s were fatally struck by a facility transport vehicle, and one person was injured. The police have arrested a 75-year-old suspect who was driving the transport vehicle and are conducting a detailed investigation into the circumstances surrounding the incident.

In other news, following the discovery of marijuana and stimulant drugs in the student dormitory of the Nihon University American Football Club, it has been revealed through interviews with the university that nine active club members are currently under voluntary questioning by the Tokyo Metropolitan Police in relation to violations of the Narcotics Control Act.

Lastly, Mos Food Service, the operator of Mos Burger, has issued an apology to individuals involved after it was discovered that posters featuring talents from Johnny & Associates, a talent agency, were inappropriately altered and displayed in some of their stores. And now for the weather. Today in Tokyo, the weather will be sunny with a maximum temperature of 28°C and a minimum temperature of 27°C.  And that's all for today's news. Thanks for listening to Japan Daily News.
