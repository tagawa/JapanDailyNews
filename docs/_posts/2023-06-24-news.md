### Transcript

Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on June 24th, 2023. Today, we have some significant news stories from Japan.

First, in a historic move, the city of Noda in Chiba prefecture has officially expressed condolences for the Fukuda Village Incident, which took place 100 years ago during the aftermath of the Great Kanto Earthquake. The incident involved a group of traveling merchants who were killed by a local vigilante group. Noda city will also attend a memorial event in September to foster a connection with the victims' families.

Moving on to transportation news, JR East has been facing technical issues with its mobile Suica app and the Ekinet reservation system. Since midnight, users have been unable to charge their mobile Suica cards or make seat reservations online. In addition, credit card payments are not accepted at ticket machines or ticket counters, and the company's website has been inaccessible. The problem is attributed to a system server power failure, and there is currently no estimated time for recovery. However, the website has gradually become accessible since 6:30 am. It's worth noting that passengers with remaining balances on their mobile Suica cards can still pass through the gates, and cash purchases at ticket machines and ticket counters are unaffected.

In other news, a tragic accident occurred in Kimitsu, Chiba prefecture, where a car driving in the wrong direction collided head-on with a light truck. The elderly driver of the wrong-way car was killed in the accident.

Moving on to the legal front, the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department plans to re-arrest former senator Gassy on charges of witness intimidation. Gassy, who was previously arrested and prosecuted for repeatedly threatening celebrities on a video-sharing website, is now accused of making intimidating remarks on social media towards individuals who filed criminal complaints against him. The re-arrest is scheduled for today.

Shifting gears to the world of art, a collection of illustrations depicting a post-war world 155 years into the future will be unveiled for the first time in Tokyo starting from June 27th. Renowned manga artists such as Takao Saito and Takashi Yanase have used their imaginations to create these illustrations.

In the realm of airport security, a panel of experts appointed by the government has proposed transferring the responsibility of security checks from airlines to airport administrators. The aim is to enhance the rigor of the inspections, and a reassessment of the cost burden on users is also recommended.

Tragically, the body of a 6-year-old boy was discovered in a grassy area in Kobe's Nishi Ward. The child had extensive bruising on his back, and the cause of death is believed to be traumatic shock. It is suspected that the boy may have been subjected to physical violence, and the police are conducting an investigation.

Lastly, Emperor and Empress of Japan have returned home after completing their official visit to Indonesia, marking their first goodwill visit since ascending to the throne. And now for the weather. Today in Tokyo, the weather will be partly cloudy with a high of 25°C and a low of 24°C. There is a 66% chance of rain.  And that's all for today's news. Thanks for listening to Japan Daily News.
