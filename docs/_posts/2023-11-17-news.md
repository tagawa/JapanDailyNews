Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on November 17th, 2023. In today's news, a developing low-pressure system is causing strong winds and snowfall in western Japan and other regions. The Japan Meteorological Agency is warning of strong winds, high waves, and potential landslides, urging caution against lightning strikes and gusts such as tornadoes. In sports news, Yuzuru Hanyu, the two-time Olympic champion in men's figure skating, announced his divorce on his official social media account, citing online harassment and stalking. Moving on to the economy, as the repayment of 'zero-zero loans' becomes a challenge for many companies, the Financial Services Agency is urging financial institutions to shift their support towards business revitalization, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises facing excessive debt. In politics, the ruling Liberal Democratic Party and Komeito plan to submit a bill to the Diet next week regarding the relief of victims of the former Unification Church, while the opposition parties are calling for the review of a bill already submitted by the Constitutional Democratic Party. On the transportation front, the final major construction work at JR Shibuya Station in Tokyo, related to the redevelopment of the Shibuya area, will cause partial suspension of the Yamanote Line on the 18th and 19th, with reduced services on other sections. JR is encouraging passengers to use alternative lines such as the Saikyo Line. In a wildlife incident, an 80-year-old man was injured after being attacked by a bear near a junior high school in Aga Town, Niigata Prefecture. The police and the local authorities are issuing warnings in the area. Lastly, in a criminal case, four individuals, including a 45-year-old gang member, have been arrested on suspicion of abandoning the body of a 55-year-old man in the mountains of Ogano Town, Saitama Prefecture. The police believe the incident is related to a dispute over borrowed money and are investigating further details. And now for the weather. Today in Tokyo, the weather will be partly cloudy with a high of 17°C and a low of 12°C. There is a chance of rain and the UV index is 4.
