Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on July 5th, 2023. In weather news, Kyushu, which experienced record-breaking heavy rain due to the influence of a front extending from a low-pressure system, is expected to see heavy rain again overnight on the 6th. There is a risk of landslides and other disasters as some areas have loosened ground due to the previous rainfall. Please remain cautious. Moving on to crime news, in the case of the quadruple murder in Nakano City, Nagano Prefecture, the police have decided to arrest the suspect on suspicion of killing a woman in her 60s. The suspect was previously arrested on suspicion of murdering two women and two police officers. In political news, the Lower House of the Diet will hold a closed deliberation today in response to the ongoing troubles with the My Number Card. The government plans to integrate the My Number Card with the current health insurance card next autumn, and discussions between the ruling and opposition parties are expected. Shifting to economic news, according to a survey by the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, the average household income per household in 2021 decreased by over 3% compared to the previous year, marking the first decrease in four years. Factors such as the expiration of COVID-19 relief payments and an increase in elderly and single-person households are cited as reasons for the decline. In international news, the Ministry of Defense has announced that two Russian frigates sailed through the connecting waters around the Senkaku Islands in Okinawa Prefecture.
