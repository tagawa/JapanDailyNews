Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on August 23rd, 2023. In today's news, the scorching heatwave continues to pose a danger in Akita, with temperatures expected to reach 39 degrees Celsius. It is crucial to take precautions against heatstroke in these extreme conditions. On the other hand, western Japan is experiencing unstable atmospheric conditions, with the possibility of intense thunderstorms, flooding in low-lying areas, lightning strikes, and strong gusts. Moving on to our next story, in Fukuoka, the sister of a robbery-murder victim has been arrested for allegedly transferring a large sum of money to an acquaintance over the course of several years. The amount is estimated to be at least 10 to 20 million yen. The police are conducting a detailed investigation into the relationship between the three individuals involved. Shifting our focus, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare has finalized its budget request for the 2024 fiscal year, seeking over 33.7 trillion yen due to increased social security expenses resulting from the aging population. This amount is approximately 590 billion yen higher than the initial budget for the 2023 fiscal year. As wildfires continue to ravage various parts of the world, a fire has also broken out in the mountainous forests of northeastern Greece, resulting in the tragic loss of 18 lives. Authorities are investigating the possibility that the victims may be undocumented immigrants and are working to confirm their identities. Meanwhile, in Hawaii, the mountain fire on Maui Island has been burning for two weeks now. The death toll has reached 115 people, but only 35 individuals have been identified so far, making the urgent task of confirming their identities a top priority. Turning our attention to Tokyo, new information has emerged regarding the Komaeda robbery case, where a 90-year-old woman was killed. According to sources, a senior member of a fraudulent group based in the Philippines was witnessed giving instructions to the perpetrator while both were in the same detention facility. Finally, in Niigata's Myoko City, a state of drought has led to the withering of crops. To secure agricultural water supply, emergency measures have been implemented, allowing water to be drawn from wells used for melting snow during the winter. That's all for today's news. Thank you for listening to Japan Daily News. And now for the weather. Today in Tokyo, there will be moderate to heavy rain showers with a high temperature of 28°C and a low temperature of 28°C.  And that's all for today's news. Thanks for listening to Japan Daily News.
