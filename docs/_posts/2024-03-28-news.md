Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on March 28th, 2024. In today's news, students at Tokyo Art University have reenacted the anthem of the former Tokyo Fine Arts School at a concert. The anthem, which was not established at Tokyo Art University, was played and performed at the concert on the evening of the 27th. Moving on to another story, a 72-year-old man was found dead on an escalator at JR Mito Station. The investigation revealed that there were signs of congestion in the upper body of the man. The police suspect that strong force was applied when part of his jacket got caught in the escalator. Now, let's turn our attention to the situation in Okinawa. Two ships belonging to the Chinese Coast Guard have intruded into Japanese territorial waters near the Senkaku Islands. The Japan Coast Guard has been issuing continuous warnings for them to leave the territorial waters. Shifting gears, we have news from the Takarazuka Revue. In a press conference today, the results of discussions between the family of a 25-year-old troupe member who died and the Takarazuka Revue will be explained. The family claims that the troupe member was subjected to power harassment by upperclassmen. They have been working towards reaching an agreement regarding apologies from the upperclassmen to the family. On to education news, there is a shortage of classrooms in special needs schools nationwide, affecting over 3,300 schools. This has led to disruptions in classes, particularly in urban areas. Lastly, we have an interview with a woman from Suzu City who experienced physical and mental distress after her inn was affected by a disaster. She expressed her desire to simply regain a sense of normalcy and wondered if things would ever return to how they were. And finally, popular comedian Matsumoto Hitoshi, from the comedy duo Downtown, has initiated a lawsuit seeking compensation from the publisher of Weekly Bunshun, which published a woman's testimony of sexual misconduct against him. The trial began today at the Tokyo District Court, and the publisher is expected to vigorously contest the claims. And now for the weather. Today in Tokyo, the weather will be overcast with a maximum temperature of 14°C and a minimum temperature of 10°C. There is a 0% chance of rain and a UV index of 3. The average temperature will be 12°C.  Visit JapanDailyNews.com for the news, yen exchange rates, and a daily Japanese proverb.
