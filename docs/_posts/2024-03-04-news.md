Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on March 4th, 2024. In our first story, a fishing boat carrying 25 people capsized off the coast of Kozushima Island in the Izu Islands. The Japanese Coast Guard received a report that one person, a Japanese man, was missing. They immediately launched a search and rescue operation, successfully rescuing 24 crew members. Our thoughts go out to the missing individual and their loved ones.

Moving on to our second story, Nissan is facing allegations of unfair practices. It has been revealed that Nissan unilaterally reduced the payment to dozens of subcontracted parts manufacturers, which is in violation of subcontracting laws. The Japan Fair Trade Commission is planning to issue a recommendation to Nissan, urging them to take measures to prevent such actions in the future. The total amount of wrongfully deducted payments is estimated to be around 3 billion yen.

Next, in the aftermath of the Noto Peninsula earthquake, residents of the coastal areas in Toyama City have formed a group called the 'Victims' Association.' The association aims to expand support for affected residents and will be making requests to the city for assistance with housing.

In logistics news, due to the '2024 Problem' of driver shortages, delivery companies are making efforts to expedite the transportation of packages. One approach being taken is utilizing passenger planes and bullet trains to ensure faster delivery times.

Moving on to our fifth story, the cause of the helicopter accident involving the Ground Self-Defense Force last year in Miyakojima waters, Okinawa Prefecture, has been determined. The investigation revealed that the helicopter crashed due to a simultaneous decrease in output from both engines. The Ground Self-Defense Force will release an investigation report as early as March.

In a groundbreaking development, three individuals, two men and one woman, have been found guilty of operating a large-scale anime piracy website based in China. The Chinese court handed down a guilty verdict, marking the first time criminal penalties have been imposed overseas as a result of Japan's efforts to combat piracy.

And finally, tragedy struck in Hokkaido as a 28-year-old man riding a snowmobile was caught in an avalanche in the mountains of Shimamaki Village. Sadly, his death has been confirmed. Our deepest condolences go out to his family and friends. That concludes today's news from Japan Daily News. Thank you for listening. And now for the weather. Today in Tokyo, the weather will be sunny with a maximum temperature of 13°C and a minimum temperature of 7°C.
