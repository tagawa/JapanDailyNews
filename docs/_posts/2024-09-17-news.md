Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on September 17th, 2024. Typhoon 14 is making headlines today as it is expected to approach Okinawa and the Amami region on the 18th. Authorities are urging residents to prepare early as winds and rainfall are predicted to intensify in these areas. Meanwhile, JR Takasaki Line has resumed operations after a temporary suspension due to a personal injury incident. The line between Tokyo and Takasaki is back on track as of 7:12 AM today. Additionally, the Shonan Shinjuku Line has also resumed services on its northern route connecting to the Takasaki Line.

In other news, a fire broke out on the rooftop of the Tottori Police Station on the evening of the 16th. Fortunately, there were no injuries reported, although two outdoor air conditioning units were damaged. Investigations into the cause of the fire are currently ongoing by both the police and fire departments.

On the transportation front, a multi-vehicle accident occurred at the Misse Tunnel, located on the border between Fukuoka and Saga Prefectures, on the evening of the 16th. Eight people, including children, sustained injuries, but all are reported to be conscious and in stable condition.

As we observe Respect for the Aged Day today, it's important to note that the number of working seniors aged 60 and over has reached an all-time high, with approximately 3.625 million seniors aged 65 and above. However, concerning statistics from the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare reveal that last year saw a record 39,702 seniors suffer injuries or fatalities due to workplace accidents.

Lastly, in a tragic incident on the 16th, a man was fatally struck by a vehicle on the Tomei Expressway in Atsugi, Kanagawa Prefecture. The vehicle, believed to be a truck, fled the scene, prompting police to launch a hit-and-run investigation. And now for the weather. Today in Tokyo, expect a warm day with a high of 31 degrees Celsius and some patchy rain, especially in the afternoon, while the moon will be a bright waxing gibbous.
