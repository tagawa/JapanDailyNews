Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on April 27th, 2024. In Musashimurayama City, an initiative is underway to provide donated uniforms to middle school students who are unable to wear their own due to damage. The uniforms, donated by graduates, are cleaned and provided to the students by a company. This effort aims to support students who may otherwise be unable to afford new uniforms.

It has been one week since the helicopter accident involving two Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force helicopters during a training exercise near the Izu Islands. The search for the seven missing crew members continues, as the main parts of the aircraft have not yet been found. The Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force is conducting search operations and working to determine the cause of the accident.

Following a fatal accident at a 'Type 4' railway crossing in Gunma Prefecture, Chichibu Railway in Saitama Prefecture has announced plans to abolish 'Type 4' crossings, where there are no barriers or warning signals, as a general rule. The railway company will expedite discussions with local governments to install barriers and warning signals in cases where it is difficult to abolish these crossings.

In the investigation of the murder case in Nasu Town, Tochigi Prefecture, where the bodies of a married couple were found, a hammer with bloodstains was discovered in a vehicle registered under the suspect's name. The Metropolitan Police Department will conduct further examination to determine if the hammer was used as the murder weapon.

JR East has formulated a response policy for dealing with customer harassment, commonly known as 'Kasuhara,' as incidents of train crew and station staff being verbally abused by passengers continue to occur. This is the first time JR East has established a policy specifically addressing 'Kasuhara.'

After consuming milk provided in school lunches in Miyagi Prefecture, a significant number of children and students reported symptoms such as diarrhea and abdominal pain. According to NHK, at least 590 individuals have been affected. The public health center in Sendai City is conducting inspections to investigate the cause of these health issues.
