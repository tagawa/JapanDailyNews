Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on July 21st, 2024. In today's news, Japan is experiencing a scorching heatwave as the regions of Chugoku and Kinki have officially entered the summer season. The Japan Meteorological Agency has announced that the rainy season is likely over in these areas, with clear skies expected for the next week. However, caution is advised as temperatures have already exceeded 35 degrees Celsius in some parts of Western and Eastern Japan, increasing the risk of heatstroke.

Moving on to our next story, today marks the one-year anniversary of a tragic incident in Miyawaka City, Fukuoka Prefecture. Last year, three children lost their lives while playing in a river during their summer vacation. Local residents have gathered near the site to pay their respects and offer condolences to the victims.

In other news, the Tama Monorail service has been temporarily suspended due to track inspections between Takahata Fudo Station and Manganji Station. The monorail has been out of service since early morning, and there is no estimated time for resumption of operations.

Tragedy strikes again in Kitakyushu City's Kokura Kita Ward, where a fire broke out in a residential area, resulting in the deaths of an elderly couple. Authorities are currently unable to contact the couple and are working to identify them while investigating the cause of the fire.

A heartbreaking accident occurred in Kawachi Town, Ibaraki Prefecture, as a second-grade elementary school girl was fatally struck by a community bus while crossing a prefectural road. The 72-year-old driver has been arrested, and further investigation is underway to determine the circumstances of the accident.

On the weather front, Typhoon No. 3 is gradually developing and moving northwest. There is a possibility that it will approach the Sakishima Islands in Okinawa Prefecture around the 24th of this month. Please stay updated on the latest typhoon information and take necessary precautions.

Lastly, on the global stage, a significant system failure occurred in various parts of the world on the 19th. The cause was identified as a security software issue, affecting an estimated 8.5 million devices. Microsoft has acknowledged the incident and continues to address the situation.

That concludes today's news from Japan Daily News. Thank you for listening. And now for the weather. Today in Tokyo, the weather will be mostly sunny with a maximum temperature of 34°C and a minimum temperature of 27°C. There is a 100% chance of light rain showers in the morning. The UV index is 8, indicating very high UV levels. Overall, it will be a hot and humid day with a slight chance of rain.
