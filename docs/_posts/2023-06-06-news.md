Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on June 6th, 2023. The Tokyo Olympics and Paralympics face significant governance challenges, according to a report by the Tokyo Metropolitan Government's audit committee. The committee noted that a series of incidents in which former officials and executives of the organizing committee were prosecuted highlighted major issues with governance. In other news, rare rainstorms hit several regions in Japan over the weekend, causing flooding and damage. The Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology analyzed the rainfall and determined that it was rarer than a once-in-a-century event. Also, the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant has started injecting seawater into the tunnel for discharging treated water into the ocean. Tokyo Electric Power Company began filling the tunnel with seawater to dilute the treated water accumulated in the plant, and the remaining construction work is scheduled to be completed by the end of this month. Furthermore, the city of Sagamihara in Kanagawa Prefecture has decided to develop new child care facilities where children can be taken care of on Sundays and holidays, even if there is no urgent need. The city hopes to encourage families with children to move to the area by providing such facilities. Emperor Naruhito attended a viola concert for the first time since his accession to the throne. The concert was one he had attended almost every year during his time as Crown Prince. Unfortunately, there were also some tragic incidents, including a car accident in which an elderly driver crashed into a fire station in Machida, Tokyo, killing one pedestrian, and two workers who were working in a manhole in Nagaoka, Niigata Prefecture, died from oxygen deficiency.  And now for the weather. Today in Tokyo, it will be mostly sunny with an average temperature of 21 degrees Celsius, reaching a high of 23 and a low of 19. There is no chance of rain and the UV index is 5.  And that's all for today's news. Thanks for listening to Japan Daily News.
