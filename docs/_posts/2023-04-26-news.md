Welcome to Japan Daily News for April 26, 2023. Let's take a look at today's headlines.

First up, the Japanese Society for Artificial Intelligence has issued a statement calling for the responsible use of AI, particularly the use of large-scale generative models such as ChatGPT. While acknowledging the high effectiveness of these technologies, the society emphasizes that they are still in the developmental stage and need to be used correctly.

Moving on, police in Hiroshima have confirmed that a paper bag found in a restroom at the JR Hiroshima Station building contained a lost attache case and not any dangerous materials. The police had suspected the bag to contain suspicious items and conducted an investigation.

In other news, the Chinese aircraft carrier Shandong has been observed sailing towards the South China Sea with fighter jets and other aircraft taking off and landing on the vessel. The Japanese Defense Ministry has been analyzing the situation, noting that China seems to be improving its carrier capabilities.

Meanwhile, police in Tochigi have conducted a search of related parties involved in a pig farm where an outbreak of Classical Swine Fever occurred last year. The farm had failed to report the outbreak, violating the Livestock Infectious Diseases Prevention Act.

The car of National Public Safety Commission Chairman, Mr. Tani, was involved in a collision with a motorcycle in Chiyoda Ward, Tokyo, on the 25th. Fortunately, there were no injuries, and Mr. Tani was not affected in his official duties.

On the weather front, the Japan Meteorological Agency has released a three-month forecast predicting that temperatures across the country will be at or above average. With the risk of heatstroke increasing from May, the agency is urging people to take early measures such as testing their air conditioning.

Lastly, the Japanese government has announced that all Japanese nationals who wished to evacuate from Sudan have been successfully evacuated. However, one person remains in the southern part of the country, and the government will continue to provide support. In a related story, the Nagoya High Court has overturned a lower court's decision and recognized a suicide by a 26-year-old male employee of Chubu Electric Power as a work-related accident.

And that's all for today's news. Thanks for listening to Japan Daily News.
