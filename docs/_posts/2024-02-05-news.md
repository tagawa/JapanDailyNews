Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on February 5th, 2024. In our first news story, train services on the Keisei Main Line and Narita Sky Access Line have resumed. Due to a power line failure, both lines were suspended in both directions between Senju-Ohashi Station and Ichikawa-Mama Station on the Keisei Main Line, and between Keisei-Takasago Station and Higashi-Matsudo Station on the Narita Sky Access Line. However, as of 9 a.m., train services have been restored.

Moving on to our second news story, the Kanto-Koshin region, including Tokyo's 23 wards, is expected to experience heavy snowfall starting this afternoon. A low-pressure system moving along the south coast of Honshu will bring heavy snow to mountainous areas and along the mountains in the Kanto-Koshin region. Even the plains, including Tokyo's 23 wards, may see snowfall. Please be aware that if temperatures drop lower than expected, there is a possibility of severe snowfall, which could impact transportation.

Next, in a heart-wrenching story, a man in Wajima City, Ishikawa Prefecture, continues to search for his younger brother, whose whereabouts remain unknown. The man expressed his frustration, saying, 'We didn't fight much as brothers, but this time, I really want to shout, 'Where are you?' It has been five weeks since the Noto Peninsula earthquake, and there are still people waiting for their families whose safety is unknown in the affected areas.

In other news, approximately 1,700 households in the Noto region of Ishikawa Prefecture are currently experiencing power outages as of 5 a.m., according to Hokuriku Electric Power Transmission and Distribution.

The earthquake and heavy snowfall have also impacted transportation in Ishikawa Prefecture, affecting railways, air travel, buses, and roads.

Furthermore, information regarding water supply support has been announced for nine cities and towns in Ishikawa Prefecture on February 5th. Please note that information about bathing support will be provided as soon as it becomes available.

Lastly, in Himeji City, Hyogo Prefecture, 34 people who consumed Ehomaki sushi rolls made by a local restaurant have reported symptoms such as diarrhea and vomiting. The Himeji City Health Center has confirmed that it is a case of food poisoning and has imposed a ban on the restaurant's operations. And now for the weather. Today in Tokyo, the weather will be cloudy with a maximum temperature of 6°C and a minimum temperature of 1°C. There is a chance of light rain in the afternoon. The average temperature will be 3°C.
