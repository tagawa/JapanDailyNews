Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on February 28th, 2024. In today's news, the Japanese government has designated approximately 20% of the country's artificial cedar forests, totaling 980,000 hectares, as 'priority areas' for the purpose of combating hay fever. These areas will undergo concentrated logging and replanting efforts by each prefecture.

Moving on to our next story, there are challenges in reaching an agreement within the government regarding the export of defense equipment to third countries for joint development, such as the next-generation fighter aircraft. The ruling Liberal Democratic Party is in favor of the exports, while the coalition partner Komeito is taking a cautious stance, resulting in difficulties in reaching an agreement by the end of this month.

In other news, the Tokyo Metropolitan Government plans to distribute 10,000 yen worth of gift certificates to households exempt from resident taxes and other low-income households to support those struggling with the high cost of living.

Yesterday evening, Their Majesties the Emperor and Empress visited an art exhibition in Tokyo that showcased the works of domestic and international artists addressing environmental issues.

A 26-year-old construction worker in Chiba Prefecture was arrested on suspicion of violating the Firearms and Swords Control Law after admitting to stabbing himself in the abdomen. The incident occurred in a park in Yotsukaido City on February 21st.

The government is making preparations for the construction of shelters on remote islands in Okinawa and other areas in case of emergencies. These shelters will be designated as 'specific temporary evacuation facilities' and will have strong structures with walls at least 30 centimeters thick. The government aims to finalize the design guidelines by the end of March.

Lastly, here is some information about water supply support scheduled for today, February 28th, in various locations in Ishikawa Prefecture, including Wajima. And now for the weather.
