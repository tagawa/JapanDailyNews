Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on August 6th, 2024. Today, we have two significant news stories from Japan.

First, on the 79th anniversary of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima, the city is emphasizing the importance of nuclear disarmament. As tensions rise in the international community and the road to nuclear abolition becomes more challenging, Hiroshima is strongly urging the world to recognize the devastating consequences of nuclear weapons and to work towards a world free of nuclear threats.

Moving on to the economy, the latest household survey by the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications reveals that real household consumption in June has decreased for the second consecutive month. Adjusting for price fluctuations, households with two or more members spent 1.4% less compared to the same month last year. The average consumption per household was 288,888 yen.

In other news, June's real wages have shown a positive growth of 4.5% compared to the previous year, marking the highest increase in 27 months. This increase in cash earnings, which includes regular wages and bonuses, has also led to a positive growth in real wages, reflecting the impact of inflation.

Moving on to the weather, intense heat is expected across western and eastern Japan today, with 29 prefectures issuing heatstroke alerts. Dangerous heat of up to 38 degrees Celsius is forecasted in Fukuoka and Oita prefectures. It is crucial for everyone to continue taking measures to prevent heatstroke.

In Saitama prefecture, there has been a series of suspicious fires in areas such as Kuki and Okegawa. In response to these incidents, local firefighters conducted patrols in residential areas during the night on August 5th.

Shifting gears to the logistics industry, which is facing a severe shortage of manpower, truck manufacturers are implementing new measures. They are introducing trucks that can be driven with a regular driver's license and enhancing driving support functions.

Lastly, a recent NHK opinion poll reveals that over 70% of respondents believe that the threat of nuclear weapons is increasing worldwide. This survey was conducted in light of August 6th, the anniversary of the Hiroshima atomic bombing, and August 9th, the anniversary of the Nagasaki atomic bombing.

That concludes today's news from Japan Daily News. Thank you for listening. And now for the weather. Today in Tokyo, the weather will be partly cloudy with a maximum temperature of 34°C and a minimum temperature of 28°C.
