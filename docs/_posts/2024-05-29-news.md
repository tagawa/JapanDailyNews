Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on May 29th, 2024. In our first news story, composer Yuzuru Asai's work has been selected for this year's Ohtaka Award, which honors outstanding orchestral compositions in Japan. The award ceremony took place in Tokyo on the evening of the 28th. Moving on to our next story, the Kanto region experienced strong winds and rain overnight, resulting in injuries and damage from fallen trees. Although the Japan Meteorological Agency has stated that the risk of heavy rain has subsided, they have issued a warning for sudden heavy rain in the Izu Islands until midday. Now, let's turn our attention to Fukui, where the shipment of juvenile pufferfish, a winter delicacy known as Wakasa Fugu, began in Obama City on the 28th. Meanwhile, in Hokkaido's Kushiro City, a collective grazing event called 'Issai Nyuiku' was held at a ranch operated by the city. This event allows dairy farmers to temporarily entrust their growing dairy cows to the ranch before the busy summer season. Shifting gears to Fukuoka, the Miyajitake Shrine in Fukutsu City has started blooming with approximately 100,000 irises, delighting visitors with their vibrant colors. In other news, five transportation companies in Kumamoto Prefecture, including bus and train operators, have decided to discontinue the use of national transportation IC cards for fare payments by the end of this year. Instead, they plan to introduce touch payments such as credit cards within the current fiscal year. Lastly, in a significant legal battle, the Supreme Court's Grand Bench will hold arguments on the 29th in five lawsuits where individuals who were forcibly sterilized under the former Eugenic Protection Law are seeking compensation from the government. The plaintiffs will share their long-standing suffering, claiming that their freedom to have and raise children was taken away by the government's policy. That concludes today's news report from Japan Daily News. Stay tuned for more updates tomorrow. And now for the weather. The weather in Tokyo today is expected to be sunny with a high temperature of 25 degrees Celsius and a low temperature of 18 degrees Celsius.
