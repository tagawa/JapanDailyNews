### Transcript

Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on July 26th, 2023. In our first news story, the population of Japan has decreased for the 14th consecutive year. As of January 1st this year, the population stood at just over 122.42 million, a decrease of around 800,000 people compared to the previous year. This decline in both the number and rate of population is the largest since the survey started in 1968 and for the first time, all 47 prefectures in Japan have experienced a decrease in population.

Moving on to our next story, today marks the 7th anniversary of the Sagamihara disability facility attack, where 19 people were tragically killed. A commemoration ceremony is being held at the facility, and members of the public are also offering their condolences with floral tributes.

Now, let's turn our attention to a disturbing incident in Sapporo's bustling district of Susukino. The dismembered body of a man was found in a hotel, leading to the arrest of a father and his 29-year-old daughter. The police have seized a car believed to have been used for transportation to the crime scene, as surveillance footage captured two individuals resembling the suspects in a similar vehicle. The investigation is ongoing as the police delve deeper into the details.

Shifting gears, we have news related to a case of potential misconduct involving Big Motor and Sompo Japan, one of the leading non-life insurance companies. It has been revealed that Sompo Japan resumed its business dealings with Big Motor without conducting a thorough investigation, despite receiving information about possible irregularities from an employee who had been seconded to Big Motor. The company acknowledges that there was an error in their decision-making process and is conducting a detailed inquiry into the matter.

In other news, discussions on raising the minimum wage reach a critical stage today at the Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare's deliberation council. With the continued rise in prices, the focus is on whether the council will provide a guideline for a significant wage increase, surpassing 1,000 yen per hour on average nationwide, following the momentum of substantial wage hikes during the spring labor negotiations.

Moving on to a tragic incident in Oita, where two male workers were swept away while performing construction work in a river in Yufu City on the afternoon of the 25th. One of the workers was found over 10 kilometers downstream, and unfortunately, his death has been confirmed. Authorities are urgently working to identify the other missing worker.

Lastly, a heartbreaking incident occurred within the premises of the US military's Misawa Air Base in Aomori Prefecture. On the morning of the 25th, a young boy was discovered unconscious near a lake and was later pronounced dead at the hospital. The search is also underway for a missing woman in the vicinity. The US military and local authorities are conducting joint search efforts to locate her.
