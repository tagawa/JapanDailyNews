### Transcript

Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on July 17th, 2023. It has been one week since the record-breaking heavy rain in northern Kyushu, which caused significant damage and resulted in the death of 9 people in Fukuoka, Saga, and Oita prefectures. Recovery efforts are underway in the affected areas, with residents and volunteers working tirelessly to remove the mud and debris from their homes. Meanwhile, Akita prefecture is also experiencing heavy rainfall, and there is a possibility of more rain in the Tohoku region in the coming days. Due to the high risk of landslides and floods, residents are advised to stay updated on the latest weather information and avoid approaching swollen rivers and slopes.

In addition to the rainfall, a severe heatwave is forecasted from Tohoku to Kyushu, with 32 prefectures issuing heatstroke alerts. Yesterday, temperatures reached as high as 39.7 degrees Celsius in Gunma prefecture. It is crucial to use air conditioning appropriately and avoid unnecessary outdoor activities to prevent heatstroke.

In other news, a study conducted by a group of researchers from the University of Tokyo suggests a possible link between the severity of influenza and gut bacteria. The study found that higher basal body temperature activates gut bacteria, reducing the likelihood of severe influenza symptoms.

Lastly, tragic news from Kanagawa prefecture, where a 30-year-old man lost his life while swimming with friends at the Chigasaki beach. The exact circumstances surrounding his death are currently under investigation. Meanwhile, the water level of the Omono River in Akita City has fallen below the dangerous level, but caution is still advised as the water level remains high. The government and meteorological agencies continue to urge local authorities to provide evacuation information and ensure the safety of residents. And now for the weather. Today in Tokyo, the weather will be mostly sunny with a high of 27°C and a low of 25°C. There is a 85% chance of high temperatures and a 88% chance of dry weather. The UV index is 7, indicating high sun exposure. Enjoy the day!  And that's all for today's news. Thanks for listening to Japan Daily News.
