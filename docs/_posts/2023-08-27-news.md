### Transcript

Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on August 27th, 2023. A checklist has been developed by a support group for children refusing to go to school and a psychiatrist to help parents and guardians decide whether to let their children skip school based on their behavior and gestures indicating their reluctance to attend.

As Typhoon 10 moves northward off the coast of Minamitori Island, it is expected to head northward off the coast of Kanto and Tohoku on the 28th, bringing strong winds, swells, and high waves with caution needed in the Pacific side of northern Japan. Meanwhile, Typhoon 9, a very strong typhoon, is slowly moving southward over the eastern sea of the Philippines and is expected to cause high waves in the Okinawa region starting around the 29th. Please stay updated on the latest information regarding both typhoons.

Two children were injured when they were hit by a jet ski on Lake Biwa in Otsu City. A 35-year-old suspect has been arrested for driving the jet ski without a license, and the police are investigating the circumstances surrounding the incident.

Due to the issuance of a record-breaking short-duration heavy rain warning and sediment disaster alert, Ono City in Fukui Prefecture has issued evacuation information for 24 households and 48 people in the Shimoyama area of the city at 9:30 p.m. on the 26th. The information corresponds to Level 3 of the five-level alert system, urging elderly people and those with physical disabilities to start evacuating.

The atmosphere has become highly unstable over a wide area from northern to western Japan due to warm and humid air, among other factors. It is estimated that intense rainfall of approximately 100 millimeters occurred in one hour until 8 p.m. in Fukui Prefecture. As the ground has become loose due to the rain that has fallen so far, it is necessary to be on high alert for sediment disasters.

The Japanese Embassy in Beijing has called on Chinese authorities to take strict measures in response to harassing phone calls and other actions directed at individuals and organizations in Japan from China, following the response to the handling of treated water at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant.

According to the Japan Meteorological Agency, intense rainfall of approximately 100 millimeters in one hour was observed until 8 p.m. near Ono City in Fukui Prefecture. In Shimoyama, Ono City, 98 millimeters of intense rainfall was recorded in one hour. With the danger of a disaster approaching, the Japan Meteorological Agency has issued a "record-breaking short-duration heavy rain warning" and is urging people to ensure their safety. And now for the weather. Today in Tokyo, the weather will be partly cloudy with a maximum temperature of 28°C and a minimum temperature of 27°C. There is a 86% chance of rain with 1.9 mm of precipitation. The UV index is 6, indicating moderate UV levels. The wind speed will be 15 km/h coming from the east. Overall, it will be a warm and rainy day in Tokyo.  And that's all for today's news. Thanks for listening to Japan Daily News.
