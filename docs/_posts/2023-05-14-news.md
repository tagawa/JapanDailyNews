Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on May 14th, 2023. The J-League celebrates its 30th anniversary, with a tribute to super sub, Yasuyuki Moriyama, who scored 23 goals as a substitute in J1 matches. The Japan Meteorological Agency warns of unstable weather conditions in western Japan, with the possibility of thunderstorms, strong winds, and heavy rain. Experts report that certain areas in Ishikawa's Suzu City, which experienced a magnitude 6.6 earthquake on May 5th, are susceptible to unique tremors that can cause significant damage to wooden houses. Meanwhile, Narita Airport saw a recovery in international flight usage during the Golden Week holiday, with over 560,000 passengers, about half of the pre-pandemic level. In other news, a group of railway enthusiasts caused a temporary suspension of the Tokaido Line in Odawara, Kanagawa, by entering the tracks to take photographs. The first-ever gathering for families of victims of work-related accidents was held at a memorial facility in Hachioji, Tokyo, to help prevent isolation and provide mutual support. Finally, a mock trial event featuring the AI judge, ChatGPT, at the University of Tokyo, sparks discussions about the future of the judicial system.  And that's all for today's news.
