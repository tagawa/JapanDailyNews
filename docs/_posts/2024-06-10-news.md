Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on June 10th, 2024. In a tragic incident, a 57-year-old woman was fatally attacked with a knife on the streets near JR Yokohama Station last night. The suspect, a 33-year-old man, turned himself in at a nearby police station and has been arrested on suspicion of murder. The police are investigating the details of the incident.

Today, the revised Immigration Control and Refugee Recognition Act comes into effect. The new law revises the rules for deportation and detention of foreigners. It includes provisions for the deportation of individuals who have made three or more asylum applications, aiming to prevent abuse of the system and ensure swift assistance for those genuinely in need of protection. However, concerns have been raised about the transparency of the screening process.

In a case that has raised serious concerns about the protection of customer information, the Securities and Exchange Surveillance Commission is considering recommending administrative penalties for three companies, including Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, for sharing confidential customer information without authorization. It is believed that customer information was shared illegally with more than 10 companies. Some customer companies became aware of the information leak during their dealings with securities firms and reported the issue.

A 22-year-old mother has been arrested on suspicion of abandoning the body of her newborn baby girl in a house in Ichikawa, Chiba Prefecture. The baby's body was found in the residence.

In a racing accident that took place at a racecourse in Murata-cho, Miyagi Prefecture, entrepreneur Yusaku Maezawa, who was participating as a driver, was taken to the hospital. Maezawa later updated his social media, stating that he suffered minor injuries and is now resting at a hotel.

A 21-year-old nursery school worker has been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after allegedly attacking a young boy with a knife-like object at a certified children's facility in Kagoshima City. In response to the incident, the facility held a meeting with parents, where the chairman and others apologized and provided an explanation of the situation.

Tragedy struck when a fishing boat capsized near Hitachinaka City, Ibaraki Prefecture. A man in his 60s, who had been in critical condition, was pronounced dead at the hospital. And now for the weather. Today in Tokyo, there will be light rain with temperatures ranging from 18 to 22 degrees Celsius.
