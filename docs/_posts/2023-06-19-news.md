Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on June 19th, 2023. Today, we have two significant news stories from Japan.

First, Emperor and Empress of Japan are currently visiting Indonesia, and today they will meet with President Joko Widodo and his wife. The meeting will take place at the Presidential Palace, where they will attend a luncheon.

In other news, an arrest has been made in the case of a fatal assault in Yokohama's Totsuka Ward. Back in February, a 78-year-old man was walking along a sidewalk when he was repeatedly struck from behind with a stick-like object, resulting in his death. The police have interviewed a 64-year-old company employee, who is suspected of carrying out the assault. The suspect denies the allegations.

Moving on to other stories, the autobiography of renowned musician Ryuichi Sakamoto, who passed away in March of this year, is set to be published. The editor, who wrote the afterword on behalf of Sakamoto, reveals some details about his final days.

In Hokkaido, a tragic accident occurred on the national highway in Yawata District. A long-distance bus traveling from Sapporo to Hakodate collided with a truck, resulting in the death of five bus passengers. The police believe that the truck veered into the opposite lane, causing the accident.

The Japan Badminton Association has undergone a change in leadership following a series of scandals, including embezzlement by former staff members. On the 18th, Mr. Mitsuru Murai, the former chairman of the J-League (Japan Professional Football League), assumed the position of the new chairman. The association has also introduced a new structure that actively promotes the appointment of external personnel and female directors.

Lastly, there was a train service disruption on the Keio Line due to a personal accident. However, as of 8:19 PM, the train service has resumed between Shinjuku Station and Tsutsujigaoka Station in Chofu City.

And finally, during their visit to Indonesia, Emperor Naruhito and Empress Masako had the opportunity to visit the newly opened underground subway car depot, which was made possible with the support of Japan. This marks Indonesia's first-ever subway system.

That's all for today's news from Japan Daily News. Stay tuned for more updates tomorrow. And now for the weather. Today in Tokyo, the weather will be partly cloudy with a high of 23°C and a low of 21°C. There is a slight chance of rain in the afternoon.  And that's all for today's news.
