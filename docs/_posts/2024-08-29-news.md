Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on August 29th, 2024. In today's news, we begin with the impact of Typhoon 10, which made landfall near Satsumasendai City in Kagoshima Prefecture early this morning. The Japan Meteorological Agency has issued special warnings for strong winds and high waves across most of Kagoshima, excluding the Amami region. Residents are being urged to take maximum precautions as the typhoon brings severe weather conditions, including a line of heavy rainfall that has already been reported in Oita and Miyazaki Prefectures. The agency warns that the risk of landslides and flooding in low-lying areas is significant, and people are advised to seek safety in sturdy buildings, preferably on higher floors.

As the situation develops, Fukuoka Prefecture's Kamimachi has issued evacuation information for all 3,173 households and 7,148 individuals, particularly focusing on the elderly and those with disabilities. This alert comes as the region prepares for potential landslides due to the heavy rains associated with the typhoon.

In Oita City, the Miyagawa River has overflowed, prompting emergency safety measures for 1,256 households and 2,311 residents in the vicinity. Authorities have activated the highest level of emergency response, Level 5, advising residents to move to higher ground or to the upper floors of nearby buildings to ensure their safety.

Meanwhile, reports of strong winds and damage are already emerging from Miyazaki, as the typhoon continues to sweep through the region. The situation is being closely monitored, and updates on the tidal changes in Kagoshima and Miyazaki will be provided as they are available. The community is urged to remain vigilant and prioritize their safety as the storm progresses. And now for the weather. Today in Tokyo, expect partly cloudy skies with a high of 31 degrees Celsius and a low of 27 degrees, and there's a chance of light rain later in the day.
