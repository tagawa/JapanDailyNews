Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on October 9th, 2024. In a significant move towards public health, Yokohama City has officially decided to ban smoking in all parks managed by the city starting in April next year. This decision aims to prevent passive smoking and enhance the enjoyment of public spaces for all visitors, including those at popular spots like Yamashita Park.

In legal news, the long-standing case of Iwao Hakamada has taken a pivotal turn. After spending 44 years on death row for a crime he did not commit, Hakamada's innocence has been confirmed as the prosecution announced today that they will not appeal the recent ruling that declared him not guilty in the retrial of a family murder case from 58 years ago. This decision by the prosecution means that Hakamada will finally be released from the status of a death row inmate.

In other news, the tragic incident involving a sightseeing boat off the coast of Shiretoko has raised serious safety concerns. Following the sinking of the vessel which resulted in 26 deaths and missing persons, it has come to light that the company's president had failed to maintain communication with the boat after its departure. Authorities are preparing to charge the president with negligent homicide as investigations continue into this devastating event.

In Osaka, police are investigating the suspicious death of a one-year-old boy found unconscious in an apartment complex. The child was discovered with severe abdominal injuries, leading authorities to suspect foul play. The boy's mother and her partner are being questioned as part of the ongoing investigation.

Lastly, in Iwate Prefecture, the body of an elderly man was found in the mountains, believed to be a victim of a mushroom-picking accident. This incident has raised alarms as several other elderly individuals have gone missing in the region while foraging, prompting police to advise against solitary excursions in the wilderness. And now for the weather. Today in Tokyo, expect light rain with temperatures around 17 degrees Celsius, and the moon will be a waxing crescent.
