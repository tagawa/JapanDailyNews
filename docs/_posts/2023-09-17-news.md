### Transcript

Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on September 17th, 2023. In today's news, we start with the weather. Kyushu is experiencing highly unstable atmospheric conditions, with localized development of rain clouds due to the influence of moist air flowing in along a front. The Japan Meteorological Agency is urging caution against landslides, flooding in low-lying areas, and rising river levels. Moving on to disaster prevention, the city of Yokohama is hosting the 'National Conference on Disaster Prevention,' also known as 'Bousai Kokutai.' This conference brings together municipalities, companies, and other organizations to showcase their efforts in disaster prevention.

Next, we turn our attention to Kyoto, where 'smart garbage bins' have been installed in Arashiyama. These bins are equipped with automatic compression technology, increasing their capacity by five times. This initiative comes just before the autumn foliage season, aiming to improve waste management in the popular tourist area.

As we continue with the weather, it remains scorching hot in various parts of Japan. Western and eastern regions are experiencing clear skies and the continuation of intense summer heat, with some areas expected to reach temperatures surpassing 35 degrees Celsius. Heatstroke alerts have been issued in Kanto-Koshinetsu and Chugoku regions, emphasizing the importance of staying hydrated even if you don't feel thirsty.

Turning to Fukushima, the city of Iwaki is facing the aftermath of record-breaking heavy rainfall. Many homes have been affected by flooding, prompting a surge in volunteer activities. As the long weekend begins, numerous volunteers are assisting with the cleanup, including removing mud from underneath houses.

In Yokohama, a tragic incident unfolded at a ramen restaurant. The 33-year-old manager was found dead inside the establishment, and evidence suggests a struggle took place. The cause of death is believed to be exsanguination from a knife wound. The police have classified this case as a murder and are analyzing surveillance footage from the vicinity to aid their investigation.

Lastly, in Saitama, a worker lost his life in an accident at an industrial waste processing facility. While using a crane to move a container, the man was struck with great force when the container accidentally fell. The police are investigating the incident as a potential case of negligence resulting in death.

That concludes today's news report. Thank you for tuning in to Japan Daily News. Stay informed, stay safe, and have a great day! And now for the weather.
