Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on April 29th, 2024. In today's news, the G7 Climate and Energy Meeting has begun in Italy. The meeting, which brings together climate and energy ministers from the seven major countries, will focus on strengthening greenhouse gas reduction efforts. Key topics include expanding renewable energy and reducing coal-fired power generation. The meeting aims to showcase concrete initiatives in these areas.

Moving on to local news, a tragic incident occurred in Chiba yesterday. A 5-year-old girl was hit by a train on the JR Uchibo Line in Tateyama City.

The Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare has revealed that it will conduct its first survey on the handling of unclaimed bodies. When individuals without relatives pass away, local governments are responsible for cremation and other procedures. However, there are no unified criteria for these procedures, leading to potential issues. The survey aims to gather information on the current situation and establish standardized guidelines.

Similar hot weather is expected across the country today, with temperatures nearing 30 degrees Celsius in many areas. It is important to take precautions and manage one's health.

Turning to a criminal case, new information has emerged regarding the suspect in the Tochigi body disposal incident. It has been revealed that after lending his car to two acquaintances believed to be involved in the crime, the suspect had contact with another individual at a pub in Tokyo. This person may have been involved in directing the disposal of the bodies or have connections to those responsible. The Tokyo Metropolitan Police are intensifying their investigation and gathering more details about the incident at that time. And now for the weather. Today in Tokyo, the weather will be mostly sunny with a high of 24°C and a low of 19°C.  Visit JapanDailyNews.com for the news, yen exchange rates, and a daily Japanese proverb.
