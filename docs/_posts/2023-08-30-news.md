### Transcript

Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on August 30th, 2023. In today's news, we have two significant stories coming from different parts of Japan.

First, in Niigata and the Kanto-Koshinetsu region, we are expecting a scorching hot day with temperatures reaching 38 degrees Celsius. This dangerous heatwave has prompted authorities to issue a strong warning against heatstroke. Please take extra precautions to stay cool and hydrated.

Meanwhile, in Osaka, a police officer fired three shots from his gun after being threatened with a knife-like object during a routine questioning. The suspect sustained injuries to his leg and was later arrested for obstructing a police officer. The incident is currently under investigation.

Moving on to another news story, today marks the 10-year anniversary of the introduction of the 'Special Warning' system by the Japan Meteorological Agency. This system is activated when there is an extremely high possibility of severe disasters such as heavy rain and tsunamis. In nearly 90% of the cases where the 'Special Warning' was issued for heavy rain, landslides and river flooding occurred. Experts emphasize the importance of not taking the absence of a 'Special Warning' lightly and urge people to evacuate when necessary.

In weather news, Typhoon 9 is expected to pass through the southern waters of Taiwan, bringing high waves to the Yaeyama Islands in Okinawa Prefecture. Additionally, Typhoon 11 is currently moving westward over the eastern seas of the Philippines and may approach Okinawa Prefecture after the 31st. Stay updated with the latest information and exercise caution.

Shifting our focus to Fukushima, it has been one year since the partial lifting of evacuation orders in some areas of Futaba Town, which was previously designated as a 'difficult-to-return' zone due to the nuclear accident. However, the number of residents who have returned remains relatively low, with only around 80 people currently residing in the town. The improvement of living conditions continues to be a challenge.

Lastly, in Saga Prefecture, there is a suspected outbreak of Classical Swine Fever (CSF) in pigs at a pig farm in Karatsu City. The prefectural government has established a task force to respond to this situation.

That's all for today's news. Stay tuned for more updates and have a great day! And now for the weather. Today in Tokyo, the weather will be partly cloudy with a maximum temperature of 28°C and a minimum temperature of 27°C. There is a 97% chance of high temperature, 40% chance of overcast, and 85% chance of dry weather. The UV index is 6, and there will be 11.8 hours of sunshine. No rain or snow is expected. Have a great day!  And that's all for today's news. Thanks for listening to Japan Daily News.
