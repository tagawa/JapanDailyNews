### Transcript

Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on September 3rd, 2023. In today's news, we have two significant stories.

First, Typhoon 11 is currently moving westward over the waters south of Ishigaki Island in Okinawa Prefecture. It is closest to the southern islands of Okinawa and residents are advised to be cautious of high waves and strong winds. At the same time, Typhoon 12 is located in the waters north of the Ogasawara Islands. Warm and humid air is flowing into the surrounding areas, including Kanto and Tokai, which may result in localized heavy rain accompanied by thunderstorms. People are urged to be mindful of potential landslides and other hazards.

Moving on to our second story, since the introduction of electric kick scooters without the need for a driver's license in July, more than 400 cases of traffic violations involving these scooters have been reported nationwide in just one month. The police are cracking down on these violations to ensure safety on the roads.

In other news, the Japan Confederation of A- and H-Bomb Sufferers' Organizations has launched a special website featuring exhibition panels from the Atomic Bomb Exhibition held by the organization at the United Nations. The website aims to raise awareness of the threat of nuclear weapons and the reality of atomic bombings to people around the world. It is available in English, and translations into languages of nuclear-armed countries are also being considered.

The Japan Society of Obstetrics and Gynecology has announced the establishment of a preparatory committee to address the issues surrounding assisted reproductive technology. The committee will discuss the specific roles and responsibilities of a public institution to deal with these issues.

Additionally, Typhoon 11 is expected to approach the southern islands of Okinawa on tomorrow, while Typhoon 12 will approach the Ogasawara Islands tonight. Residents are advised to be cautious of high waves and heavy rain accompanied by thunderstorms.

In a separate development, in the case involving Member of the House of Representatives Mari Akimoto and the former president of a wind power generation company, it has been revealed through interviews with relevant parties that the funds provided by the former president were intended as a gratuity for parliamentary questioning. The Tokyo District Public Prosecutors Office's Special Investigation Department is also investigating Akimoto's awareness of the situation. And now for the weather. Today in Tokyo, there will be moderate to heavy rain showers with temperatures ranging from 26 to 28 degrees Celsius.  And that's all for today's news. Thanks for listening to Japan Daily News.
