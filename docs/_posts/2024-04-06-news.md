Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on April 6th, 2024. In Nagano, the cherry blossoms have bloomed at the Takato Castle Ruins Park, also known as the 'number one cherry blossom spot.' The blossoms arrived 11 days later than last year, but they are now in full bloom. Moving on to Ibaraki, the shipment of spring melons, the local specialty, has started in Hokota City. Ibaraki is the top producer of melons in Japan, and this year's harvest is expected to be bountiful. Now let's turn our attention to Kochi, where the 'Kochi Castle Flower Corridor' event has begun. The event decorates Kochi Castle with flower arrangements and lanterns, creating a beautiful spectacle for visitors. This year's event promises to be just as enchanting as previous years. Shifting gears to Osaka, there's an update regarding the Osaka-Kansai Expo. The Expo organizers have reversed their decision and will now allow visitors to bring food into the venue. This change comes after reviewing the inspection methods for personal belongings at the entrance. And in Taiwan, a group of university students from Oita City in Oita Prefecture has started a donation campaign to support the victims of the recent earthquake in eastern Taiwan. The students will donate the proceeds from their cafe to aid in the relief efforts. Speaking of the earthquake, today marks 72 hours since the earthquake struck, and the Taiwanese authorities are intensifying their search for the 10 individuals who are still missing. Finally, a report from the Japanese National Police Agency reveals that there is an increasing trend of bicycle accidents involving children during the months of April to June. The police urge everyone to prioritize traffic rules and ensure the safety of children riding bicycles. That's all for today's news. Thank you for listening to Japan Daily News. And now for the weather. Today in Tokyo, the weather will be light rain with temperatures ranging from 10 to 12 degrees Celsius.
