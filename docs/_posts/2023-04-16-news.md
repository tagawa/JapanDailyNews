### Transcript

Welcome to Japan Daily News on April 16th. Today marks the 7th anniversary of the Kumamoto earthquake that caused 276 casualties, including disaster-related deaths. While infrastructure restoration efforts are underway, the challenge now lies in how to convey the memories and lessons learned from the earthquake.

In other news, an explosive device was thrown at a campaign event attended by Prime Minister Fumio Kishida in Wakayama City. The police found a tube-like object with a wire-like substance at the end, and are investigating the possibility of it being a "steel pipe bomb." A 24-year-old suspect has been arrested for suspected obstruction of official duties.

The weather is expected to be very unstable in the Kyushu to Kanto-Koshin region due to strong cold air flowing in the upper atmosphere, with the Meteorological Agency warning of lightning, tornadoes, and sudden heavy rain.

A fire broke out in a house in Kiryu City, Gunma Prefecture, and two bodies were found at the site. The police are investigating the cause of the fire and trying to confirm the identity of the deceased, who are believed to be an elderly couple.

At the G7 climate, energy, and environment ministers' meeting, the focus has been on decarbonizing the automotive sector. The ministers are expected to agree on efforts to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 50% based on each country's vehicle ownership.

Regarding the helicopter accident involving the Ground Self-Defense Force in the vicinity of Miyako Island, Okinawa Prefecture, the Self-Defense Force plans to resume the work of divers who can perform "saturation diving" if weather conditions are met.

That's all for today's Japan Daily News.
