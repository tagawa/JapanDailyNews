Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on September 4th, 2024. In today's news, we begin with severe weather alerts as unstable atmospheric conditions are affecting the Kanto and Koshin regions. On September 4th, there is a significant risk of heavy rain accompanied by thunderstorms. Authorities are urging residents to be cautious of potential landslides, flooding in low-lying areas, and rising river levels due to the expected downpours.

Turning our attention to agricultural concerns, the country is facing a rice shortage, prompting discussions about government policies. As supermarkets report dwindling rice supplies, voices have emerged pointing to government strategies encouraging farmers to shift to other crops. In a press conference on September 3rd, Agriculture Minister Sakamoto acknowledged the long-term decline in rice demand but confirmed the intention to continue current policies.

In remembrance, today marks the 13th anniversary of the devastating Kii Peninsula floods, which resulted in 88 confirmed deaths and missing persons. In Nachikatsuura, Wakayama Prefecture, families gathered to light candles and offer prayers at the time the disaster struck, reflecting on the tragedy and its lasting impact on the community.

On a more positive note, Kansai International Airport is celebrating its 30th anniversary today. Plans to increase international passenger numbers are progressing well, especially with the upcoming Osaka-Kansai Expo. However, the airport faces challenges in staffing due to the departure of experienced personnel during the pandemic, highlighting the need for effective recruitment and training strategies.

In health news, a record heatwave this summer has led to alarming statistics in Tokyo's 23 wards, with 248 deaths suspected to be related to heatstroke as of August. Investigations reveal that over 80 percent of these cases involved individuals who either did not use air conditioning or lacked it altogether, underscoring the urgent need for enhanced preventive measures against heat-related illnesses.

Lastly, in Miyazaki Prefecture, Governor Kono visited sites affected by strong winds during the approach of Typhoon No. 10, which caused damage to agricultural greenhouses. He expressed a commitment to support affected farmers by considering measures to aid their recovery. Additionally, the Oita Expressway has reopened between Yufuin IC and Hiji Junction earlier than expected after extensive cleanup efforts following landslides caused by the typhoon. And now for the weather. Today in Tokyo, the weather is clear with a high of 25 degrees Celsius.  Visit JapanDailyNews.com for the news, yen exchange rates, and a daily Japanese proverb.
