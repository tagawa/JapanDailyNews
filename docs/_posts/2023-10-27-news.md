Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on October 27th, 2023. In today's news, a powerful hurricane has struck tourist destinations in southern Mexico, resulting in 27 confirmed deaths and severe damage to transportation and communication networks. The hurricane rapidly intensified in just 12 hours before making landfall, with the impact of climate change being cited as a contributing factor.

Moving on to our next story, train services on the Tobu Isezaki Line have been suspended between Kitakoshigaya and Kasukabe stations due to a personal accident that occurred near Kitakoshigaya station. Tobu Railway expects services to resume around 8:50 am.

In other news, elevated levels of mercury exceeding the standard limit have been detected in the drainage from a factory in Meiwacho, Gunma Prefecture. The factory has already ceased its wastewater discharge, and the prefectural government is urging people to avoid entering the surrounding rivers until detailed investigation results are available.

As Halloween approaches, the Shibuya Ward in Tokyo is implementing restrictions on street drinking around Shibuya Station starting from the evening of the 27th. This measure aims to enhance caution and prevent potential troubles during the first Halloween celebration since the transition to the fifth level of COVID-19 restrictions.

In a recent incident on the Tohoku Shinkansen, four passengers suffered burns when chemicals leaked from a passenger's baggage near JR Sendai Station on October 9th. The police have confirmed that the substances involved were sulfuric acid and nitric acid. They are now conducting a detailed investigation into the circumstances surrounding the handling and transportation of the chemicals.

Looking ahead to the weather forecast, a significant cold air mass is expected to move into Japan's airspace, causing highly unstable atmospheric conditions. Western and eastern Japan can anticipate unstable conditions on the 28th, while northern Japan should be prepared for such conditions on the 29th and Sunday. Thunderstorms, gusty winds including tornadoes, sudden heavy rain, and hailstorms require utmost caution.

Lastly, today marks the beginning of the retrial for Tsutomu Hakamada, who was sentenced to death for the murder of a family of four in Shizuoka Prefecture 57 years ago. The first hearing is taking place at the Shizuoka District Court, with Hakamada exempted from attending. His sister, Hideko, is expected to plead his innocence in court. And now for the weather. Today in Tokyo, there will be patchy rain possible with a high of 22°C and a low of 17°C.  Visit JapanDailyNews.com for the news, yen exchange rates, and a daily Japanese proverb.
