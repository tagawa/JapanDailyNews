### Transcript

Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on September 19th, 2023. In our first news story, the Japanese government has recommended the approval of a land improvement project in Henoko, which is the relocation site for the U.S. military's Futenma base in Nago City, Okinawa. This recommendation comes amidst ongoing discussions and protests regarding the construction. Moving on to our next headline, the Minister of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism held a meeting with industry representatives to discuss the strengthening of regulations on overtime work in the construction industry, which will be implemented from April next year. The meeting confirmed the commitment to promote workstyle reforms accompanied by wage increases.

Now, let's turn our attention to a tragic incident in Tokyo. A 67-year-old company employee has been arrested in connection with a hit-and-run incident in Ome City, where an elderly man was killed. The suspect is denying the allegations. In other news, the evacuation orders in Akita City have been lifted as the risk of landslides has decreased. However, precautionary evacuation information for the elderly and others is still in effect in areas near the Kusonotsugawa, Shinjogawa, and Taiheigawa rivers, where water levels are rising.

Moving on to food safety concerns, approximately 100 people have reported symptoms of diarrhea and vomiting after consuming bento boxes produced by a railway bento manufacturer called Yoshidaya in Hachinohe City, Aomori Prefecture. Health authorities are investigating the details and cause of the suspected food poisoning, which has affected individuals in 40 municipalities across the country.

In a tragic accident at a construction site near Yaesu Exit of JR Tokyo Station, two workers have died after steel beams being lifted by a crane fell, trapping five workers. The Tokyo Metropolitan Police are conducting a thorough investigation to determine the circumstances of the accident and hold the responsible parties accountable.

Lastly, heavy rainfall has been recorded in Akita, with approximately 110 millimeters of intense rain falling in one hour. The unstable atmospheric conditions are expected to continue in northern and eastern Japan, raising concerns about landslides, flooding in low-lying areas, and river overflow. Please remain vigilant and take necessary precautions.
