### Transcript

Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on August 4th, 2023. In today's news, Typhoon 6 has caused significant damage and impact in Okinawa and Kagoshima prefectures. The large and extremely powerful typhoon has resulted in 2 fatalities, 64 injuries, and power outages in over 50,000 households. Moving on to another story, a truck collided with a bus on the East Kyushu Expressway in Fukuoka. According to the police, the accident occurred before 7 am in the city of Yukihashi, and 16 high school students were transported to the hospital. Now, let's turn our attention to a university incident. In the case involving the Japan University American Football Club member suspected of possessing illegal drugs, it has been revealed that university staff discovered a plant fragment believed to be marijuana about 2 weeks ago but failed to report it to the police. This raises questions about the handling of the situation. Returning to the weather, Typhoon 6 is once again approaching the Okinawa region, causing strong winds, high waves, and the risk of high tides. Please exercise extreme caution. Additionally, the heatwave continues, and heatstroke should be taken seriously. Hokkaido, on the other hand, is experiencing heavy rain due to the influence of a front, with the possibility of exceeding a month's worth of rainfall in just a few days. This raises concerns about landslides, flooding in low-lying areas, and river overflow. Shifting gears to politics, the Tokyo District Public Prosecutors' Office's special investigation department has voluntarily interviewed the president of a wind power company regarding suspicions of providing a large amount of funds to Liberal Democratic Party member Mari Akimoto, who is also a parliamentary secretary of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The special investigation department is expected to investigate the flow of opaque funds to clarify the situation. Lastly, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare has confirmed illegal overtime work in over 14,000 locations nationwide based on on-site inspections conducted last year. This highlights the issue of long working hours in various workplaces across the country. That's all for today's news. Thank you for listening to Japan Daily News. And now for the weather. Today in Tokyo, there will be patchy rain possible with a high of 29°C and a low of 28°C.  And that's all for today's news. Thanks for listening to Japan Daily News.
