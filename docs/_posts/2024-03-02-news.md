Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on March 2nd, 2024. In today's news, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has revised its guidelines for COVID-19 isolation. The previous recommendation of a 5-day quarantine has been replaced with a new guideline that suggests a 24-hour self-isolation based on symptoms such as fever. This change aims to provide a more practical approach to managing COVID-19 cases.

Moving on to our next story, a unique memorial photoshoot took place in Matsukawa Village, Nagano. Participants had the opportunity to dress up in their preferred outfits and hairstyles to capture a final image that truly represents their loved ones. This event aimed to provide comfort and closure to those who have lost someone dear to them.

In other news, two suspects of Filipino nationality have been arrested in connection with the double homicide in Adachi Ward, Tokyo. It is alleged that the suspects entered the victims' residence while they were at home and remained hidden for several hours. The investigation is ongoing to determine the motive behind this tragic incident.

Shifting gears, let's take a look at the recovery progress two months after the Noto Peninsula earthquake. The restoration of lifelines in Ishikawa Prefecture has been steadily advancing. We will examine the current situation in the affected areas based on the latest data provided by the prefecture.

Continuing with our coverage of the aftermath of the Noto Peninsula earthquake, some individuals are still living in makeshift shelters known as agricultural houses. These resilient individuals have chosen to endure the challenging living conditions in order to stay close to their familiar surroundings. Their determination to support each other in this difficult time is truly inspiring.

Next, we have a story from Suzu City, Ishikawa Prefecture, where a 99-year-old man decided to return to the original evacuation center instead of staying in a more comfortable hotel. He expressed his belief that being in the familiar environment of the evacuation center was essential for him. This decision highlights the importance of emotional connections and a sense of community during times of crisis.

Lastly, we turn our attention to the issue of self-designated evacuation centers. The Noto Peninsula earthquake has shed light on the challenges faced by these unofficial shelters, where the identification and support of evacuees have been delayed. In our investigation, we found that only 40% of the 13 municipalities at risk of severe earthquakes had established clear protocols for self-designated evacuation centers, based on the lessons learned from the Kumamoto earthquake eight years ago. This highlights the need for improved preparedness and coordination in ensuring the safety and well-being of all residents during natural disasters.

That concludes today's news from Japan Daily News. Thank you for listening. And now for the weather. Today in Tokyo, the weather will be partly cloudy with a high of 8°C and a low of 4°C. There is a chance of patchy rain nearby in the evening.  Visit JapanDailyNews.com for the news, yen exchange rates, and a daily Japanese proverb.
