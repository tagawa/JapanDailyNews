Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on March 24th, 2024. In today's news, we have two tragic incidents involving fires, one in Chiba and another in Yokohama. In the early hours of the 24th, a fire broke out in a house in Noda City, Chiba Prefecture, resulting in the discovery of a body in the burnt remains. The resident of the house has not been contacted, and the police are working to confirm the identity of the deceased.

Moving on to Yokohama, a fire erupted in an apartment in the Midori Ward on the night of the 23rd. Sadly, an 81-year-old man and his wife, who are believed to be the occupants of the apartment, lost their lives in the incident. The police and fire department are investigating the details of the situation.

Shifting our focus, let's talk about the challenges people are facing when trying to book a move. As we approach the end of the month and the start of a new fiscal year, many people are preparing to relocate. However, this year, there seems to be even more difficulty in securing reservations. Our investigation has revealed that this is due to the logistics industry facing certain issues.

In other news, JR Kyushu's tourist train, the SL Hitoyoshi, made its final run on the 23rd, leading to an outpouring of nostalgia from the public. The train has been a popular attraction, and its retirement has left many people feeling sentimental.

Turning to international matters, a symposium was held in Tokyo to commemorate the 70th anniversary of the Bikini Atoll nuclear tests conducted by the United States. The symposium aimed to raise awareness about the global impact of nuclear damage, particularly in light of the incident involving the Japanese tuna fishing boat, the Daigo Fukuryu Maru, which was exposed to radiation.

Lastly, the Japan Federation of Bar Associations, or Nichibenren, has announced the implementation of a support system starting in April. The system aims to prevent unjust interrogations by allowing lawyers to be present during police interrogations. Lawyers who participate in this program will receive financial assistance. However, there are concerns from law enforcement agencies that this may hinder the pursuit of truth. The impact of this support system will be closely monitored in the future.

That concludes today's news from Japan Daily News. Thank you for listening. And now for the weather. Today in Tokyo, the weather will be partly cloudy with a high of 13°C and a low of 8°C. There is a 0% chance of rain and a UV index of 3.  Visit JapanDailyNews.com for the news, yen exchange rates, and a daily Japanese proverb.
