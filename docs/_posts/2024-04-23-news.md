Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on April 23rd, 2024. In today's news, the governor of Nagano Prefecture, Mr. Abe, met with Mr. Niwa, the president of JR Tokai, to discuss the Central Shinkansen Line, which has been delayed. The governor urged for the early announcement of the opening date.

In another news story, six individuals, including a senior member of a criminal organization, have been arrested by a joint investigation team comprising the Tokyo Metropolitan Police and the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare's Narcotics Control Department. They are suspected of smuggling approximately 15 kilograms of methamphetamine, worth about 940 million yen, concealed within the parts of a small conveyor belt imported from Mexico. The investigation is also looking into possible involvement of a Mexican drug cartel.

Moving on, it has been two years since the sinking of a sightseeing boat off the coast of the Shiretoko Peninsula in Hokkaido, resulting in the deaths of 20 people and leaving 6 others missing. A memorial service will be held in the town of Shari this afternoon to remember the victims and renew the commitment to prevent such accidents in the future.

In seismic news, an earthquake with a magnitude of 6.6 occurred near Taiwan at around 3:27 a.m. today. Although there may be some minor changes in the tide levels in the Okinawa mainland and Miyako and Yaeyama regions of Okinawa Prefecture for a few hours, there is no concern of any significant damage. The earthquake was shallow and did not cause any tremors of intensity 1 or higher in Japan.

Turning to a criminal investigation in Tochigi Prefecture, it has been revealed that the suspect in the case of the disposal of burnt bodies of a man and a woman in Nasu Town had purchased adhesive tape and gasoline before the incident. The Metropolitan Police Department is working to identify other individuals involved and investigate the details of the case.

In tragic news, a house fire occurred in Nakano City, Nagano Prefecture, last night, resulting in the complete destruction of a residential building. One person was found dead at the scene. The police have been unable to contact the couple who lived in the house after the fire, and they are currently working to confirm the identity of the deceased and determine the cause of the fire.

Finally, heavy rain in southern China has caused floods and landslides, resulting in the deaths of four people and leaving ten others missing. Chinese media reports the ongoing search and rescue operations in the affected areas. And now for the weather. Today in Tokyo, it will be overcast with a high of 17°C and a low of 15°C.
