### Transcript

Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on August 2nd, 2023. In our first news story, a woman was attacked by a man with a knife-like object in a restaurant parking lot in Chiba. The incident occurred in the early hours of the morning, and the woman was taken to the hospital. The suspect is currently on the run, and the police are investigating it as an attempted murder case.

Moving on to our next story, Typhoon 6 has caused widespread damage and impact in Okinawa and Kagoshima prefectures. As of 8 am today, approximately 210,000 households in Okinawa are experiencing power outages, which accounts for more than 30% of the total number of households in the prefecture.

Continuing with the typhoon-related news, transportation in Okinawa has been heavily affected. Many flights and trains have been canceled or suspended due to the typhoon. Travelers in the region are advised to check with their respective transportation providers for updates and alternative arrangements.

Shifting our focus to a different topic, there has been a disruption in train services on the JR Tokaido Line between Tokyo and Atami due to a person-related incident at Yokohama Station. Train operations have been suspended in both directions since around 7:35 am. This incident has also affected other train lines, including the Yokosuka Line, Keihin-Tohoku Line, and Shonan-Shinjuku Line. There is currently no estimate on when the services will resume.

In weather news, Typhoon 6 is approaching Okinawa Island and is causing severe winds, heavy rain, and high tides. Residents are urged to exercise extreme caution and be prepared for strong winds, high waves, storm surges, and potential landslides. A video commentary by weather forecaster Kimitoshi Sato provides further details on the typhoon's path and areas to be vigilant about.

Lastly, just days before the scheduled execution of former Aum Shinrikyo cult leader Shoko Asahara, also known as Chizuo Matsumoto, the Tokyo Detention Center submitted a document to the Ministry of Justice expressing concerns about his possible feigned illness. This sheds light on the internal discussions within the Ministry of Justice leading up to the execution. That's all for today's news. Thank you for listening to Japan Daily News. And now for the weather. Today in Tokyo, there will be patchy rain possible with a high temperature of 29°C and a low temperature of 28°C.  And that's all for today's news. Thanks for listening to Japan Daily News.
