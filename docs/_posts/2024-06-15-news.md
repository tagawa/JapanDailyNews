Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on June 15th, 2024. In today's news, a suspect has been arrested in Hachioji, Tokyo, for allegedly strangling to death his elderly sister who he lived with. The incident occurred in a condominium on the 14th of June. In another case, the common-law husband of the daughter of the victims in the Tochigi double murder has been rearrested on suspicion of murder. The bodies of a married couple, who were company executives from Tokyo, were found in Nasu Town, Tochigi Prefecture. The common-law husband, who managed a restaurant entrusted to him by the couple, was reportedly unhappy with the company's demands to contribute more of the restaurant's revenue. Moving on to other news, a meeting between a group representing Minamata disease patients and the Minister of the Environment is scheduled for July 8th to address the issue of microphone cutting during the group's discussions with ministry officials. Starting today, the 'Compensation for Crime Victims' benefit has been increased. This benefit, which is paid to the families of crime victims, will now provide more than 10 million yen to most families, even in cases where the deceased was a child or had low income. In a separate case, a tax accountant in Tokyo has been arrested for allegedly defrauding approximately 87 million yen from 34 lawyers at a major law firm. The accountant reportedly collected funds by promising that contributions to a mutual aid program for sole proprietors would be deductible as business expenses, resulting in tax savings. Shifting our focus to local news, the evacuation orders for all 160,440 households and 313,795 people in Naha City have been lifted. The city had issued the orders due to the risk of landslides. Lastly, in the case of the murder of a 17-year-old high school girl in Rumoi City, Hokkaido, in April, one of the suspects in his 20s has confessed that he knew there were no surveillance cameras around the bridge where the crime took place, making it a secluded area. That's all for today's news. Stay tuned for more updates from Japan Daily News. And now for the weather. Today in Tokyo, the weather will be mostly sunny with a high of 28°C and a low of 22°C.
