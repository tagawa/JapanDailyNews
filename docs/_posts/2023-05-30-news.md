Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on May 30th, 2023. The effective job openings-to-applicants ratio in April remained the same as March at 1.32. In Tokyo's Tachikawa, a fire broke out in a five-story apartment building, killing two women and sending one person to the hospital. The cause of the fire is under investigation. Typhoon No. 2 is expected to approach the Okinawa region from May 31st with strong winds, high waves, and heavy rain, and caution is advised. The Self-Defense Forces have deployed missile interception units in preparation for North Korea's ballistic missile launch, which is expected to occur after May 31st. The police are investigating the circumstances surrounding the two officers who were killed in the Nagano quadruple homicide case, as they were not equipped with firearms when dispatched to the scene. A group of researchers at Juntendo University has developed a method of detecting abnormal proteins that accumulate in the brains of patients with Parkinson's disease and some types of dementia from blood samples, which could lead to a simple and less burdensome diagnostic method. In Aichi Prefecture, a judgment will be handed down on May 30th in a lawsuit filed by a same-sex couple in their 30s seeking compensation from the government for violating the constitution by not recognizing their marriage. The judgment is being closely watched as previous rulings on similar lawsuits have been divided. The rainy season has started in northern Kyushu and other areas, and there is a risk of heavy rain in western Japan from May 30th to 31st, which could lead to landslides and river flooding. Meanwhile, Typhoon No. 2, which is large and extremely strong, is expected to approach the Okinawa region from May 31st with strong winds, high waves, and heavy rain, and caution is advised. And now for the weather. Today in Tokyo, there will be moderate to heavy rain showers with temperatures ranging from 20 to 22 degrees Celsius.  And that's all for today's news.
