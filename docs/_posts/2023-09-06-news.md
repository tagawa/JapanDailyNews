### Transcript

Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on September 6th, 2023. It has been 5 years since the devastating Hokkaido Eastern Iburi earthquake, which claimed the lives of 44 people. While major infrastructure restoration is nearing completion in the affected areas, there are still challenges remaining, such as providing mental care for the survivors and regenerating the heavily damaged forests.

In Aichi, a shocking incident unfolded as a 14-year-old middle school student allegedly stabbed her 40-year-old mother with a kitchen knife. The mother was rushed to the hospital in critical condition, and the police arrested the daughter on suspicion of attempted murder. The authorities are currently investigating the details of the incident.

Moving on to other news, sudden disruptions in meal services have caused inconvenience and concern in Hiroshima and Shizuoka. Seven public high school dormitories in Hiroshima have abruptly stopped receiving meals from their contracted suppliers since the beginning of this month. As a result, teachers have had to purchase lunches for the students at the Miyoshi Prefectural High School. Similarly, in Shizuoka, it has been revealed that some high schools and special needs schools are unable to provide meals due to issues with the same supplier.

Weather alerts have been issued for several regions in Japan due to the formation of a linear rain band. Unstable atmospheric conditions caused by a front and warm, moist air have led to the development of heavy rain clouds in western and northern Japan. There is a high risk of rapidly increasing disaster potential, including landslides, flooding in low-lying areas, and rising water levels and flooding in rivers in Shikoku, Niigata, Hokuriku, and Tokai regions.

In a concerning trend, a study conducted by the government research team revealed that over 100 patients who were emergency transported due to overdosing on over-the-counter drugs were predominantly young women, with an average age of 25.8 years. Many of these individuals lived with their families, and the research team emphasized the need for increased awareness and support for those who may be silently struggling with personal issues or difficulties.

The Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology will hold a meeting of the Religious Corporation Council to address issues related to the Unification Church. The ministry plans to explain its intention to seek administrative fines, known as 'karyo,' from the court for the religious organization's inadequate response to questions posed by the council. The notification will be sent to the Tokyo District Court.

And finally, the trial for the Kyoto Animation arson attack, which claimed the lives of 36 employees, began on the 5th of September. The defense lawyer for the accused, Shinji Aoba, argued that he lacked responsibility for the crime. Meanwhile, the prosecution asserted that the attack was a revenge-driven act based on a misguided belief that the studio had stolen the suspect's ideas. The question of the defendant's mental capacity and degree of responsibility will be the main focus of the trial going forward. And now for the weather. Today in Tokyo, the weather will be partly cloudy with a maximum temperature of 28°C and a minimum temperature of 27°C. There is a 97% chance of high temperature, 46% chance of overcast, and 0% chance of rain. The average UV index is 6. Enjoy your day!  And that's all for today's news. Thanks for listening to Japan Daily News.
