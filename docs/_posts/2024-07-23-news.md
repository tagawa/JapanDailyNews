Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on July 23rd, 2024. In today's news, we have some updates on transportation issues in Japan. The Tokyo Metro Chiyoda Line, which had been experiencing service disruptions due to a signal problem at Otemachi Station, has now fully resumed operations as of 8:18 am. This comes after a period of partial suspension in certain sections. Similarly, the local trains on the Joban Line, which were affected by the signal trouble on the Chiyoda Line, have also resumed operations between Ayase Station in Tokyo's Adachi Ward and Toride Station in Ibaraki Prefecture.

Moving on to the railways, the Tokaido Shinkansen is back to its regular schedule. Yesterday, there was a derailment and collision between maintenance vehicles on the line, causing significant disruptions between Hamamatsu and Nagoya. However, as of 6 am this morning, JR Tokai has announced that the entire line is operating as usual. This news will come as a relief to many passengers who rely on this important transportation route.

In other news, Japan is currently experiencing a nationwide heatwave. Today, the temperatures are expected to exceed 38 degrees Celsius in the Kanto and Tokai regions, posing a high risk of heatstroke. Authorities are urging people to avoid going outside as much as possible and to stay hydrated. It is important to take precautions and seek cool shelter during this extreme weather.

Lastly, the Nuclear Regulation Authority will hold a review meeting on July 26th regarding the potential restart of Unit 2 at the Tsuruga Nuclear Power Plant in Fukui Prefecture. The focus of the discussion is the possibility of future movement of the fault line directly beneath the reactor. There is a high likelihood that the operator's claim of no future movement will not be accepted, raising the possibility that the restart of the nuclear plant may be denied for the first time. This decision is being closely watched as it could have significant implications for Japan's energy policy and the future of nuclear power in the country. And now for the weather. Today in Tokyo, the weather will be mostly sunny with a high of 33°C and a low of 28°C. There is a 86% chance of rain and a UV index of 9.
