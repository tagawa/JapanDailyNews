Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on April 11th, 2024. In Fukui City, a devastating fire broke out in a residential house, resulting in the discovery of three bodies in the burnt remains. The house was occupied by an elderly couple in their 80s and their daughter in her 50s, all of whom have been uncontactable. The police are currently conducting investigations to determine the cause of the fire and identify the victims.

In transportation news, train services on the JR Nanbu Line were temporarily suspended due to a personal accident. However, as of 11:25 PM, the train services have resumed, bringing relief to commuters.

Moving on to natural disasters, an analysis by experts revealed that over 11,000 people in the central areas of Naha City, Ishigaki City, and Miyakojima City in Okinawa, who were within the projected tsunami inundation zones, had evacuated to higher ground during the major earthquake near Taiwan on the 3rd of this month. Some of the evacuees were tourists visiting from outside the prefecture. Experts have emphasized the need for evacuation measures, especially for travelers, during the peak tourism season.

In another train-related incident, train services on the JR Utsunomiya Line between Tokyo Station and Utsunomiya Station, as well as on the JR Shonan-Shinjuku Line between Shinjuku Station and Utsunomiya Station, were temporarily suspended due to a personal accident. However, both lines have resumed their operations at 10:36 PM.

Meanwhile, the entire section of the JR Nanbu Line between Kawasaki Station and Tachikawa Station has experienced a complete suspension of train services due to a personal accident that occurred between Yagawa Station and Taniyama Station in Tokyo and Kokuritsu City. JR East Japan has estimated that train services will resume around 11:10 PM.

In political news, Sapporo Mayor Akimoto revealed that several city employees have expressed feeling intimidated by the remarks and actions of Hasegawa Gaku, a member of the Liberal Democratic Party. Some departments have even had to send staff to Tokyo multiple times for explanations. One employee has made 23 trips in the past 10 months, amounting to expenses of 1.3 million yen.

Lastly, prominent entrepreneurs Yusaku Maezawa and Takafumi Horie attended a study session organized by the Liberal Democratic Party, where they raised concerns about fake advertisements using their images and names on social media to solicit investments. They urged for concrete measures to regulate social media platforms and protect individuals from impersonation scams. And now for the weather. Today in Tokyo, the weather will be sunny with a maximum temperature of 17°C and a minimum temperature of 12°C.
