Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on September 24th, 2024. This morning, a magnitude 5.9 earthquake struck near Torishima, prompting the Japan Meteorological Agency to issue a tsunami advisory for the Izu Islands and the Ogasawara Islands. Residents are urged to stay alert as the situation develops.

In Ishikawa Prefecture, the region has been grappling with record rainfall that has led to severe flooding and landslides. Tragically, seven people have lost their lives, and two others remain missing. Search and rescue operations are ongoing as authorities continue to assess the damage. One woman from Suzu City shared her distressing story, revealing that she lost sight of her husband during a sudden surge of water at their home and is anxiously waiting for his return.

Further complicating the situation, experts have analyzed a landslide near a tunnel in Wajima City and found that it was influenced by remnants of the New Year’s earthquake in Noto Peninsula. They suggest that the previous seismic activity may have weakened the slope, contributing to the recent disaster.

In separate news from Aomori Prefecture, a tragic accident occurred when a light truck collided with a day service transport vehicle at an intersection in Rokunohe Town. Three elderly passengers lost their lives, and four others sustained serious injuries. The community is mourning this loss as investigations into the circumstances of the collision continue.

Additionally, in Saitama Prefecture, a collision between a car and a motorcycle late last night resulted in one death and another person in critical condition. The motorcycle riders were struck at an intersection, and the driver of the car reportedly fled the scene, only to return an hour later. Police are treating this incident as a hit-and-run.

Lastly, the Tsukuba Express resumed operations this morning after a delay caused by nighttime construction work. The trains are now running between Akihabara and Moriya stations, providing service to commuters once again. And now for the weather. Today in Tokyo, expect a partly cloudy day with temperatures around 22 degrees Celsius, reaching a high of 24 degrees and a low of 20 degrees, with no chance of rain.
