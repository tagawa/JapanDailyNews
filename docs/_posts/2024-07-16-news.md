Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on July 16th, 2024. In our first news story, two Chinese ships from the Chinese Coast Guard entered Japan's territorial waters near the Senkaku Islands in Okinawa. The Japan Coast Guard immediately issued warnings and continued to monitor the situation.

Moving on to our next story, the emergency safety measures in the Kamigata area of Kakegawa, Shizuoka have been lifted. These measures were put in place to ensure the safety of 995 residents in 341 households. The situation has now returned to normal.

In Matsuyama City, the emergency safety measures that were in effect in the Shimizu area have been completely lifted. However, a partial evacuation order remains in place for approximately 65 people in 32 households. The evacuation order is at Level 4, urging residents to evacuate from dangerous areas.

Turning to the business world, companies are increasingly implementing strategies to utilize senior workers amid the labor shortage. This includes extending the period of reemployment after retirement and increasing basic salaries.

The Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism is considering measures to address transportation deserts, areas with limited transportation options. One of the key approaches being explored is the promotion of ride-sharing services. The ministry aims to formulate measures for all municipalities with transportation deserts by the end of this year.

In an effort to create products and services that are user-friendly for people with dementia, there is a growing movement of companies collaborating with individuals with dementia in the development process.

Lastly, in Kanagawa Prefecture, a 76-year-old woman was found bleeding and unconscious in a corridor of a public housing complex in Atsugi. Unfortunately, she was pronounced dead shortly after. The police have arrested a 30-year-old man who allegedly kicked a police officer during questioning. The investigation is ongoing.

That's all for today's news. Thank you for listening to Japan Daily News. And now for the weather. Today in Tokyo, the weather will be partly cloudy with a chance of rain showers. The average temperature will be 23 degrees Celsius.  Visit JapanDailyNews.com for the news, yen exchange rates, and a daily Japanese proverb.
