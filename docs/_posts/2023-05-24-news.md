### Transcript

Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on May 24th, 2023. Today, the Miyagi District Court is set to deliver a verdict on a lawsuit seeking to halt the operation of the Onagawa Nuclear Power Plant. The lawsuit was filed by local residents who argue that the plant's evacuation plan is inadequate. This is the first time a court has focused solely on the issue of an evacuation plan in a nuclear power plant case. Meanwhile, a survey by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism has found that more than 20% of individual business owners who undertake delivery work for delivery companies work for over 13 hours a day. The ministry plans to strengthen measures to improve the situation. In other news, three manta rays that were captured off the coast of Kagoshima and raised at the Kagoshima Aquarium have been released back into the sea with cameras attached to them to help study their ecology. Also, the father of a boy who was killed in the Kobe child murder case 26 years ago has called for measures to prevent the disposal of case records after it was revealed that the records had been destroyed. Finally, the Tokyo Metropolitan Government has decided to suspend six advertising companies, including Dentsu and Hakuhodo, for 18 months until August next year in connection with the Olympic bid-rigging scandal. Fujitsu has also announced that it will suspend its system for issuing My Number cards at convenience stores due to a problem that led to the issuance of incorrect documents. And now for the weather. Today in Tokyo, it will be mostly cloudy with a chance of rain and temperatures ranging from 17 to 19 degrees Celsius (62 to 67 degrees Fahrenheit).  And that's all for today's news. Thanks for listening to Japan Daily News.
