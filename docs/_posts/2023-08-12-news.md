### Transcript

Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on August 12th, 2023. In today's news, we have two major stories coming out of Japan.

First, we turn our attention to the weather. A very strong typhoon, Typhoon 7, is currently moving northward near the Ogasawara Islands. Even in regions far from the typhoon, such as Kanto and Kinki on the Pacific side, there are high waves and rough seas. It is important to exercise caution and be aware of the potential dangers. The typhoon is expected to come significantly closer to eastern and western Japan around Tuesday, the 15th of August. Please stay updated with the latest information.

Next, we have news from Iwate Prefecture. The town of Otsuchi and its surrounding areas experienced record-breaking heavy rainfall. According to the Japan Meteorological Agency, radar analysis indicates that approximately 100 millimeters of intense rain fell in just one hour until 7:10 am. The situation is becoming increasingly dangerous, prompting the agency to issue a warning for record-breaking short-term heavy rainfall and urging people to ensure their safety.

Moving on, let's talk about the weather again. Eastern and western Japan are currently experiencing a rise in temperatures, with the expected highest temperature reaching 39 degrees Celsius in cities like Nagoya and Gifu. This extreme heat poses a serious risk of heatstroke, so it is crucial to stay hydrated and take necessary precautions.

In other news, today marks the 45th anniversary of the abduction of Hitomi Soga and her mother, Miyoshi, by North Korea. To commemorate this day, Hitomi Soga has sent a handwritten comment to NHK, expressing her ongoing concern about her mother's whereabouts and urging the government to make sincere efforts to resolve the issue.

Shifting gears, we have an update on the bribery allegations involving Member of Parliament Mari Akimoto and a wind power company. The president of the wind power company has indicated to the Tokyo District Public Prosecutor's Office that he intends to admit to the charge of bribing MP Akimoto with approximately 30 million yen. However, MP Akimoto has not yet issued any comments regarding the matter.

Lastly, we remember the victims of the Japan Airlines plane crash, which occurred 38 years ago. On the 11th of August, in Ueno Village, Gunma Prefecture, the families of the victims conducted a lantern-floating ceremony in the river to mourn and remember their loved ones.

That's all for today's news. Stay tuned for more updates from Japan Daily News. And now for the weather. Today in Tokyo, the weather will be partly cloudy with a maximum temperature of 28°C and a minimum temperature of 27°C. There is a chance of patchy rain in the evening. The UV index is 7, indicating high sun exposure. Overall, it will be a warm and partly cloudy day with a chance of rain in the evening.  And that's all for today's news.
