Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on July 1st, 2023. In our first news story, the city of Nanao in Ishikawa Prefecture has issued evacuation orders due to the risk of flooding from the Kumagi River. The orders were issued at 7:50 am and cover the entire Nakajima-cho area, including 2,037 households and 4,955 people. Moving on to our next story, Yamaguchi Prefecture has experienced widespread damage as homes and cars have been submerged in water. Fortunately, there have been no reported injuries as of 7 am. However, the flooding has caused significant damage to residential areas and vehicles throughout the region.

Next, we turn to a tragic incident in Yokohama, where an 18-year-old female college student was stabbed to death on the premises of an apartment complex. The suspect, who is an ex-boyfriend of the victim, allegedly stabbed the upper body of the victim multiple times with a knife. The police are currently investigating the motive behind this horrifying crime.

The heavy rain is expected to continue in western and eastern Japan, leading to potential landslides and river flooding. Please take necessary precautions to stay safe.

In Ishikawa, the water level at the Kamogawa Observatory in Nanao City has exceeded the dangerous level for flooding as of 6:50 am. This adds to the concerns of potential flooding in the area.

In Miyazaki, the city of Ebino has issued evacuation information for all 7,895 households and 16,625 residents, particularly targeting the elderly and other vulnerable groups, due to the risk of landslides caused by heavy rain.

Lastly, in Oita, a house in Yufu City has collapsed due to a landslide caused by heavy rain. Unfortunately, one person living in the house is currently unaccounted for. The police and fire department are conducting a search operation in the vicinity of the incident.
