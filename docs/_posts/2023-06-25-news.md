Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on June 25th, 2023. In today's news, a heartbreaking incident has shocked the city of Kobe. The body of a 6-year-old boy was discovered inside a suitcase in a grassy area. The mother's family has revealed that the boy's younger brother had instructed them to prepare the suitcase. The police have arrested the mother on suspicion of causing injury to the grandmother, among other charges.

Moving on to another tragic incident, a fatal accident occurred on the Meihan Highway in Tenri, Nara. A large trailer crashed through the guardrail and rolled down the slope. Sadly, a 27-year-old truck driver was found collapsed near the overturned trailer and was pronounced dead. The authorities are investigating the cause of the accident.

Switching gears, in Hokkaido's Shibecha Town, a dairy cow was found dead after being attacked. There is a possibility that the culprit behind this repeated attack on cows over the past four years is a brown bear known as 'OSO18.' Efforts are underway to identify and capture the bear to prevent further damage.

Turning to Fukushima, the chairman of the Nuclear Regulation Authority, Shinsuke Yamane, announced that inspections of the wastewater treatment facility at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant will begin on the 28th of this month. The plan is to dilute the accumulated treated water and release it into the sea. The inspections aim to verify the overall performance of the release facility before the actual discharge.

In a historical revelation, NHK has uncovered previously unreleased audio recordings from the Battle of Okinawa during the final stages of World War II. These recordings, spanning over 30 hours, capture the harrowing reality of the ground combat from the perspective of the American Marines. The unedited audio provides a glimpse into the intense and brutal nature of the battle.

In connection to the tragic discovery in Kobe, one of the four siblings of the mother of the deceased 6-year-old boy has confessed that the assault on the grandmother was instructed by one of the boy's brothers. The investigation into this shocking case is ongoing.

Shifting our focus, an elementary school in Kamagaya, Chiba, held a disaster prevention class using augmented reality (AR) technology. The students had a simulated experience of flooding caused by heavy rainfall, aiming to raise awareness about disaster preparedness.

Lastly, JR East experienced a system failure in the early hours of the 24th. During this time, customers faced issues with credit card payments at ticket vending machines and were unable to charge their 'Mobile Suica' app. However, the company has announced that all systems have been restored as of 1:00 pm.

That wraps up today's news from Japan Daily News. Stay tuned for more updates tomorrow. And now for the weather. Today in Tokyo, the weather will be mostly sunny with a high of 25°C and a low of 23°C. There is a slight chance of rain in the morning, but overall it will be a pleasant day.  And that's all for today's news. Thanks for listening to Japan Daily News.
