Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on March 10th, 2024. In today's news, snowfall is expected in Niigata, Nagano, and the Kanto region due to the influence of a winter pressure system. It is advised to be cautious of snowfall and possible road freezing, which may affect transportation. Moving on to our next story, a survey conducted by the Cabinet Office reveals that the majority of all age groups consider combining public and individual pensions as the main approach to retirement planning. The second most popular approach varies by generation, with those aged 40 and above relying entirely on public pensions, while those in their 30s and below prefer to rely less on public pensions and prioritize individual pensions. Shifting gears, the National Center for Global Health and Medicine has announced the results of a clinical study on the effectiveness of the smallpox vaccine 'MPOX.' The study shows that over 70% of vaccinated individuals have obtained sufficient antibodies against smallpox. The research group plans to further examine the vaccine's effectiveness for individuals with weakened immune systems. Turning to our next story, new information has emerged in the corruption case involving a former Chiyoda Ward councilor in Tokyo. It is now believed that the bribery from contractors began at least seven years ago when the councilor leaked bidding information for construction projects commissioned by the ward. In transportation news, the JR Utsunomiya Line and the Shonan-Shinjuku Line have resumed operations. After suspending services due to a personal accident, both lines between Tokyo Station and Utsunomiya Station, as well as between Shinjuku Station and Utsunomiya Station, have resumed normal operations as of 7:51 PM. In the aftermath of the Noto Peninsula earthquake, the city of Suzu in Ishikawa Prefecture continues to experience water shortages. All dental clinics in Suzu are currently closed, and many affected residents are seeking treatment at temporary dental clinics set up at roadside stations. Shifting focus to cultural news, Minister of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology, Moriyama, has visited Wajima City in Ishikawa Prefecture. He announced plans to establish a project team within the Agency for Cultural Affairs to explore support measures for the recovery of Wajima lacquerware. The project team is scheduled to hold its inaugural meeting in Kanazawa City next week. And now for the weather. Today in Tokyo, the weather will be mostly sunny with a high of 10°C and a low of 4°C.  Visit JapanDailyNews.com for the news, yen exchange rates, and a daily Japanese proverb.
