Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on March 1st, 2024. In our first news story, a survey conducted by NHK and experts revealed that 84% of the survivors of the Noto Peninsula earthquake, which occurred two months ago, expressed their desire to continue living in the places and municipalities they had called home. However, many of them also expressed concerns about the possibility of another earthquake, the recovery of the region, and securing their income. This highlights the various worries that the evacuees continue to face while living in temporary shelters.

Moving on to our next story, in the civil trial surrounding the wrongful arrest case related to the false export allegations, the manufacturer in Yokohama has submitted new evidence, including internal memos from the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department, to support their claim that the case was fabricated. On the other hand, the investigating agency denies any illegality in their investigation.

Now, let's turn our attention to the Noto Peninsula earthquake again. A man in Suzu City, Ishikawa Prefecture, who has been running a long-standing public bathhouse, has decided to remain in his hometown despite the disaster. He expressed his strong attachment to Suzu, stating that it is the best place and he has no desire to move anywhere else.

In tragic news, four crew members of a scallop aquaculture fishing boat fell into the sea off the coast of Aomori Prefecture's Mutsu Bay on the night of February 29th. Three of them have tragically lost their lives, while one person remains missing. The Japan Coast Guard continues their search in the surrounding waters.

In other news, a magnitude 4 earthquake was felt in Saitama and Chiba Prefectures at around 5:43 am on March 1st. Fortunately, there is no concern for a tsunami resulting from this earthquake.

Returning to the Noto Peninsula earthquake, which occurred two months ago and registered a maximum intensity of 7, more than 10,000 people are still taking refuge in evacuation centers in Ishikawa Prefecture. The challenge now is to secure suitable housing for the survivors to live in peace. The prefecture is prioritizing the restoration of infrastructure, such as water supply and roads, as well as the construction of temporary housing.

Lastly, a 49-year-old man was arrested on February 29th in Yokohama for allegedly assaulting and killing his 80-year-old father, with whom he lived in an apartment. This tragic incident has shocked the local community. And now for the weather. Today in Tokyo, there will be light rain with temperatures ranging from 6 to 13 degrees Celsius.
