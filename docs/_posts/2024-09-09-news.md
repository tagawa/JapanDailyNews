Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on September 9th, 2024. The Japanese government is moving forward with the practical application of next-generation solar cells known as perovskite solar cells. This initiative will see these lightweight and flexible solar panels installed at three locations in Fukushima Prefecture as part of a broader effort to accelerate research and development in this area. In other news, a significant court ruling is expected today in Nagasaki regarding individuals who experienced the atomic bombing but were not officially recognized as survivors due to their location at the time. The case involves claims made by these so-called 'hibakusha' who seek acknowledgment from the city and prefecture. This follows a precedent set by a similar case in Hiroshima, where individuals exposed to radioactive rain outside designated areas were recognized as survivors. Meanwhile, today marks five years since Typhoon No. 15 caused extensive damage in Chiba Prefecture, with over 80,000 homes affected by severe winds. In response to this disaster, efforts to protect homes from future storms have been ramped up. In Miyazaki, it has been one month since a significant earthquake registered a maximum intensity of 6 on the Japanese seismic scale. Unfortunately, many accommodation facilities in popular tourist areas are still unable to provide access to their large public baths due to ongoing repairs. In weather news, Gunma Prefecture is currently under a severe weather warning as heavy rainfall has been reported. In Takasaki, about 100 millimeters of rain fell in just one hour, prompting the Meteorological Agency to issue a 'record-breaking short-term rainfall information' alert. Additionally, the Inogawa River in Takasaki has exceeded the flood danger level, raising concerns about potential flooding in the area. Another report from Gunma indicates that Matsuidamachi in Annaka has also experienced extreme rainfall, with approximately 120 millimeters recorded in a single hour, further emphasizing the need for vigilance. And now for the weather. Today in Tokyo, expect a warm day with temperatures reaching up to 32 degrees Celsius, a chance of patchy rain, and humidity around 75%.
