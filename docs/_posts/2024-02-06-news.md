Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on February 6th, 2024. Today, we have two significant news stories from Japan and one international story.

First, heavy snowfall in the Kanto and Chubu regions has caused major disruptions in transportation. Highways such as the Shuto Expressway and Tomei Expressway have been closed, and train services on the JR lines have been suspended. This has resulted in significant impacts on road and traffic conditions in Tokyo and the surrounding areas.

Moving on to our international news, today marks one year since the devastating earthquake in Turkey and Syria. More than 59,000 people lost their lives in the earthquake, and many are still living in temporary container housing. While some public housing has been provided to the affected areas in Turkey, there are still numerous challenges to overcome for the reconstruction efforts, including the continued reliance on container housing and the outflow of population.

Finally, in health news, as we enter the peak season for influenza, a new method of testing is being introduced that utilizes artificial intelligence. Traditionally, nasal swabs have been used for influenza testing, but now AI technology is being employed to streamline the process. This new method shows promise in improving the efficiency and accuracy of influenza testing.

That concludes today's news report from Japan Daily News. Thank you for listening. And now for the weather. Today in Tokyo, the weather will be mostly cloudy with a chance of rain. The average temperature will be 2 degrees Celsius.  Visit JapanDailyNews.com for the news, yen exchange rates, and a daily Japanese proverb.
