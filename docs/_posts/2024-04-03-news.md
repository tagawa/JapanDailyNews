Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on April 3rd, 2024. In breaking news, a tsunami alert has been issued for the Miyako and Okinawa islands. The Japan Meteorological Agency has announced a tsunami warning for the following coastal areas: Miyako and Yaeyama regions, with an expected height of 3 meters, and Okinawa Island region, also with an expected height of 3 meters. Residents are urged to evacuate immediately.

In other news, a tasting event for 'cold soaked soba' was held in Yamagata City. This unique dish involves soaking buckwheat noodles in cold mountain stream water during the winter to enhance their sweetness. The event was attended by producers and other stakeholders.

Moving on, let's take a look at the Noto Peninsula earthquake, which occurred three months ago. We'll review the timeline of the damages, evacuations, and water shortages. The latest data, as of April 2nd, reveals the current situation in the affected areas.

Next, a touching story from a survivor of the earthquake. They still vividly remember the sensation of their father's cold hand when they were rescued. Despite the beauty of cherry blossoms in full bloom, there is a lingering sense of unease and the feeling that time has stood still for those affected by the disaster.

Shifting gears, we head to Nara, where the Hai-ryu-ji Temple is welcoming the arrival of spring with the blooming of snow-white Yukiyanagi flowers.

Lastly, an update on the Kobayashi Pharmaceutical's 'beni koji' health supplement issue. The Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare has announced that as of April 1st, a total of 166 people have been hospitalized after consuming health products containing the ingredient 'beni koji' produced by Kobayashi Pharmaceutical. And now for the weather. Today in Tokyo, the weather will be mostly cloudy with a high of 17°C and a low of 13°C. There is a 0% chance of rain.
