Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on January 14th, 2024. In today's news, the Shinagawa Ward Office in Tokyo has implemented measures to address 'customer harassment,' where employees are subjected to unreasonable demands and complaints. To avoid online harassment, the office has decided to change the name tag display for staff from full names to last names only, and they will no longer include staff photos.

Moving on to Hiroshima, the forest fire in Edajima continues to burn with unabated intensity. Even after 20 hours since it started, the fire has not shown any signs of weakening, and firefighting efforts are ongoing. Fortunately, there have been no reported injuries, but 13 people from 9 households have been evacuated.

In other news, the recent earthquake has caused disruptions to various transportation systems and roads. As of 5:00 AM on the 14th, the extent of the impact is still being assessed.

The areas affected by the Noto Peninsula earthquake are experiencing even colder temperatures. Although the weather will temporarily improve and temperatures will rise, strong winds accompanied by rain and snow are expected from the night of the 14th until the 16th in the affected areas of northern and eastern Japan. It is advised to be cautious of heavy snowfall and its impact on transportation, as well as the risk of landslides.

For those affected by the earthquake in Ishikawa Prefecture, information regarding scheduled water supply support on the 14th is available.

Moving on to education news, the second day of the University Entrance Exam, with exams in science and mathematics, will be held today at 668 venues nationwide, including those in Ishikawa Prefecture, which was affected by the Noto Peninsula earthquake.

Lastly, in Toyama Prefecture's Himi City, which experienced a strong earthquake with a magnitude of 5, the water supply remains cut off, prolonging the stay in evacuation centers. The residents are hoping for the return of tap water soon, as their daily lives continue to be affected. And now for the weather. Today in Tokyo, the weather will be mostly clear with a high of 11°C and a low of 3°C. Enjoy your day!  Visit JapanDailyNews.com for the news, yen exchange rates, and a daily Japanese proverb.
