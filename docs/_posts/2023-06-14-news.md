### Transcript

Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on June 14th, 2023. In the wake of last year’s record heatwaves, which saw over 3,600 people hospitalized for heatstroke in May alone, disaster prevention organizations are calling for people to start acclimatizing themselves to the heat now, in preparation for another hot summer. Meanwhile, Tokyo police have called on real estate agents to help them prevent “lone wolf” attacks, following a spate of shootings by people with no criminal records or affiliations. The police are asking agents to report any suspicious activity in properties they manage. Two men have been arrested in Nagoya after attempting to rob a luxury watch store at knifepoint. The police are investigating the relationship between the two men and the circumstances that led them to target the store. In Myanmar, the military junta that has been in power since the coup earlier this year is preventing international aid agencies from entering the western regions that were hit by a devastating cyclone last month. The full extent of the damage is still unknown. The organizers of the 2025 Osaka-Kansai Expo have announced that the basic entry fee for adults will be around ¥7,500, due to increased security costs. Finally, the president of Palau, Surangel Whipps Jr., has called for greater transparency in the decommissioning of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant during a visit to the site. And now for the weather. Today in Tokyo, the temperature will be between 21 and 23 degrees Celsius with mostly cloudy skies and a chance of light rain throughout the day.  And that's all for today's news. Thanks for listening to Japan Daily News.
