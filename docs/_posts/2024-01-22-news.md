Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on January 22nd, 2024. In Ishikawa Prefecture, approximately 5,400 households are still experiencing power outages as a result of the Noto Peninsula Earthquake that occurred three weeks ago. The earthquake, which registered a magnitude of 7, has claimed the lives of 232 people, with 22 individuals still unaccounted for.

The transportation system and roads in the affected areas continue to be impacted by the earthquake. As of 5:00 AM today, there are disruptions to railway services, aviation, and road networks.

To address the ongoing water shortage caused by the Noto Peninsula Earthquake, water supply support is being provided in nine cities and towns in Ishikawa Prefecture. The situation is being updated regularly.

Despite a decrease in the frequency of earthquakes since the Noto Peninsula Earthquake, seismic activity remains active, with nearly 1,500 noticeable tremors. The Japan Meteorological Agency has issued a warning for potential earthquakes with a magnitude of 5 or higher for the next two weeks. Additionally, heavy snowfall is expected from tomorrow onwards, particularly in the affected areas, which may further impact transportation.

As the Noto Peninsula Earthquake enters its third week, maintaining the health of evacuees, with over 15,000 people still residing in shelters, and addressing the ongoing water shortage, affecting more than 49,000 households, are pressing concerns. Furthermore, individuals considering seismic reinforcement for their homes express worries about the financial burden involved.

In an effort to raise awareness about the abduction issue by North Korea, a gathering was held in Takamatsu City on the 21st. Takuya Yokota, the younger brother of Megumi Yokota, emphasized the urgency of finding a swift resolution as their family members grow older.

In a tragic hit-and-run incident in Abiko City, Chiba Prefecture, a man in his 50s lost his life. The police have arrested a 28-year-old hairdresser on suspicion of drunk driving, hitting the man, and fleeing the scene. And now for the weather. Today in Tokyo, the weather will be partly cloudy with a high of 9°C and a low of 8°C. There is a chance of light rain in the evening.
