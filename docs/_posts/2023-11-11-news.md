Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on November 11th, 2023. In today's news, we have two significant stories from Japan.

First, credit card payment troubles that occurred in supermarkets and JR stations across the country have now been resolved. The credit card payment system operated by 'Nihon Card Network' experienced a glitch in the afternoon, but the company announced that the issue was resolved after 10:00 PM. The exact cause of the trouble is still under investigation.

Moving on to our second story, a magnitude 4 earthquake was observed in Tokushima Village, Kagoshima Prefecture at around 10:02 PM. Fortunately, there is no concern for a tsunami caused by this earthquake.

In other news, there has been a series of toy ingestion accidents, leading to the implementation of stricter regulations. As Christmas approaches, some families are considering purchasing toys for their children. However, there have been incidents where children accidentally swallowed toys, resulting in the need for surgery. The influx of toys, including those subject to recalls overseas, through online shopping platforms has raised concerns. In response, the government has begun implementing regulations with the power to ban sales and enforce safety standards. Later in the article, we provide a summary of points to consider when purchasing toys and important precautions.

Furthermore, JR Saikyo Line, which had suspended operations between Osaki Station and Omiya Station due to a personal accident, has now resumed services as of 10:38 PM.

Additionally, JCB, a credit card company, announced that the credit card payment troubles that occurred nationwide have been resolved. The subsidiary of JCB, 'Nihon Card Network,' which operates the credit card payment system, experienced a system failure. However, the exact cause of the issue remains unknown. This incident led to payment troubles in supermarkets, convenience stores, and JR stations across the country, affecting purchases and transactions.

Moreover, a fire broke out in a sixth-floor room of a seven-story public housing building in Takarazuka, Hyogo Prefecture. Unfortunately, two individuals lost their lives in the incident.

Lastly, ahead of the 46th anniversary of Megumi Yokota's abduction by North Korea, a gathering was held in Niigata City, where the incident took place. Family members expressed their anguish over being separated from their loved ones and called on the Japanese government to resolve the issue as soon as possible. And now for the weather. Today in Tokyo, the weather will be partly cloudy with a maximum temperature of 12°C and a minimum temperature of 11°C. There is a 53% chance of rain.
