Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on February 8th, 2024. In the morning of February 8th, a fire and sparks were observed coming from the 'exhaust fan' in the turbine building of Unit 1 at the Tsuruga Nuclear Power Plant in Tsuruga City, Fukui Prefecture. There have been no reports of injuries, and Japan Atomic Power and others are investigating the situation.

In the early hours of February 8th, a fire broke out in one room of an apartment building in the Yawata Nishi Ward of Kitakyushu City, resulting in the deaths of two people. The police are working to confirm their identities and investigate the cause of the fire.

In the aftermath of the Noto Peninsula earthquake, there have been 35 cases of crimes such as burglary in the disaster-stricken areas in the past month, according to the Ishikawa Prefectural Police Headquarters. The police plan to strengthen patrols in the affected areas to crack down on these crimes.

The national basic plan, which sets goals such as reducing the number of fatalities by 80% in preparation for a Nankai Trough mega-earthquake, is being reconsidered and likely to be postponed until this spring due to the impact of the Noto Peninsula earthquake.

This year marks the 70th anniversary of the 'Bikini Incident,' in which Japanese fishing boats, including the fifth Fukuryu Maru and fishing boats from Kochi Prefecture, were exposed to radiation during the US hydrogen bomb tests in the Pacific. On March 1st, the families of former crew members from Kochi Prefecture will attend a ceremony held in the Marshall Islands to call for the abolition of nuclear weapons.

In other news, water supply support is scheduled to be provided in areas such as Wajima and Suzu in Ishikawa Prefecture on February 8th.

On the evening of February 7th, in the vicinity of two parks in Isezaki City, Gunma Prefecture, a medium-sized dog kept in the neighborhood bit a total of 12 people, including 9 elementary school students, causing minor injuries to 11 of them. The dog has been captured, and the police are investigating the situation by interviewing the owner. And now for the weather. Today in Tokyo, the weather will be mostly clear with a high of 9°C and a low of 6°C.  Visit JapanDailyNews.com for the news, yen exchange rates, and a daily Japanese proverb.
