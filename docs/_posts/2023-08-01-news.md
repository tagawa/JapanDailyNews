First, let's talk about the unemployment rate. According to the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications, the national unemployment rate for June improved by 0.1 percentage points to 2.5%. This is a positive sign, indicating a slight recovery in the job market.

Moving on to the job market, the job-to-applicant ratio for June was 1.30, which is slightly lower than the previous month by 0.01 points. This is the second consecutive month of decline, and the Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare attributes it to the impact of high prices, which has led to an increase in job seekers.
