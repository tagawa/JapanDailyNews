Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on June 1st, 2024. In today's news, Tokyo University and other researchers have discovered that coral spawning, which can be observed on early summer nights, reaches its peak earlier when there is more rain and sunshine. This finding is based on data obtained from 15 years of coral breeding. Moving on to our next story, it has been five months since the Noto Peninsula earthquake. Toyama Prefecture, which experienced significant liquefaction damage, has started drilling surveys in four cities, including Takaoka, to investigate ground measures. The challenge is to determine the most suitable methods for the region. In other news, a tragic incident occurred in Iinohi City, Saitama, where a parent and child were found dead inside a car parked on a forest road. They had been reported missing, and the police are currently investigating the circumstances of their deaths. As we mark the fifth month since the Noto Peninsula earthquake, preventing disaster-related deaths and isolation remains a priority. While nearly 70% of the required temporary housing has been completed in Ishikawa Prefecture, allowing more affected residents to live in new homes, measures to prevent disaster-related deaths and isolation are still necessary. Shifting our focus, an earthquake with a magnitude of 4 was recorded in Susaki, Kochi, at around 4:02 a.m. today. Fortunately, there is no concern for a tsunami. In another news story, during the investigation of the shooting incident involving a taxi driver in Kawaguchi City, Saitama, the police confiscated one live round from the suspect's home. The police suspect that the suspect had stored the handgun and live ammunition and are conducting a detailed investigation into the source of the firearms. Finally, in a court case where the director of an ophthalmology clinic in Hyogo Prefecture sued a reviewer for damaging their reputation by posting comments on Google Maps, the Osaka District Court ordered the reviewer to delete the article and pay 2 million yen in compensation. And now for the weather. Today in Tokyo, the weather will be partly cloudy with a high of 24°C and a low of 18°C. There is a chance of light rain showers throughout the day.
