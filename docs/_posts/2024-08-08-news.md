Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on August 8th, 2024. In today's news, Kobayashi Pharmaceutical will hold a half-year financial results briefing in response to the ongoing controversy surrounding their red yeast rice supplements. The new president and the former president, who is from the founding family, will attend the briefing to explain the new management structure and address the responsibilities of the management team.

Meanwhile, a fire that started from waste materials at a recycling company in Shizuoka continues to burn. Despite efforts to extinguish the fire, it has been ongoing since last night. Fortunately, there have been no reported injuries.

Moving on to other news, Typhoon No. 5 has formed in the waters south of the Ogasawara Islands. Residents of the Ogasawara Islands are advised to be cautious of potential landslides and to prepare for strong winds and high waves in the evening.

In a criminal case, a 32-year-old company employee has been arrested for fraudulently obtaining online game points and converting them into cash. The Tokyo Metropolitan Police suspect that the employee had been repeating this scheme and illegally profited millions of yen. The investigation is ongoing.

As for the weather, dangerous heat is expected in western Japan today, with the risk of heatstroke. Please continue to take measures to prevent heat-related illnesses. On the other hand, the atmospheric conditions in Tohoku, Kanto-Koshin, and other areas are very unstable due to warm and humid air, which may result in extremely heavy rainfall accompanied by thunderstorms. Residents are advised to be cautious of landslides, flooding in low-lying areas, and river flooding.

In other news, the Mayor of Nagasaki will provide an explanation of the city's position regarding the exclusion of the Israeli Ambassador from the Peace Memorial Ceremony on August 9th, the anniversary of the atomic bombing of Nagasaki. The exclusion has raised concerns, and the Mayor aims to seek understanding and clarify the city's stance.

Lastly, Tokyo Women's Medical University has dismissed its director, Ms. Iwamoto, following a police search related to the unclear flow of funds involving an alumni organization. The university held an emergency board meeting on the 7th and decided to remove Ms. Iwamoto from her position. The university will now focus on implementing measures to prevent a recurrence and develop improvement plans. And now for the weather. Today in Tokyo, the weather will be partly cloudy with a maximum temperature of 33°C and a minimum temperature of 27°C. There is a high chance of rain showers throughout the day.
