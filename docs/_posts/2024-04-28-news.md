Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on April 28th, 2024. In tragic news, a 17-year-old high school student drowned in the Ibi River in Kuwana, Mie Prefecture. The incident occurred late in the evening while the student was playing with friends. The police are currently investigating the details surrounding the incident.

Moving on to politics, by-elections have begun in three constituencies for the House of Representatives. The Tokyo 15th District, Shimane 1st District, and Nagasaki 3rd District are all holding by-elections. The results of these elections could potentially impact Prime Minister Kishida's future governance and the dissolution strategy of the House of Representatives.

In Tokyo's Minato Ward, an event is being held to promote dialogue and understanding about aging. Through conversations with elderly individuals and exhibitions about aging, the event aims to encourage contemplation on the process of growing old.

The recipients of the 'Spring Honors' awards have been announced. These awards are given to individuals and organizations who have made significant contributions in various fields, such as the arts and sports. Among the 651 individuals and 14 groups receiving the awards are renowned actor Mieko Harada and Yasunori Danda.

A tragic car collision occurred on a national highway in Nagano Prefecture. A small passenger car and a regular passenger car collided head-on, resulting in the death of a 0-year-old boy who was in the small car. Additionally, four individuals suffered severe injuries, including broken ribs.

On the first day of the Golden Week holiday, a long line of over 500 people formed for the free distribution of food to those in need at a park in Tokyo. Despite the transition to the fifth category of the COVID-19 measures and the continuous rise in prices of food and utilities, the number of people relying on such support remains high.

Lastly, the iconic Japanese monster, Godzilla, made a virtual appearance at the Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building through a massive projection mapping display. This spectacle delighted fans and showcased the creative use of technology in entertainment. And now for the weather. Today in Tokyo, the weather will be sunny with a maximum temperature of 25°C and a minimum temperature of 18°C.
