Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on July 8th, 2024. In today's news, the base pay for workers in May saw a significant increase, reaching the highest growth rate in approximately 31 years. However, real wages, which take into account the rise in prices, have been negative for 26 consecutive months, indicating that wage growth is not keeping up with inflation.

Moving on to transportation news, train services on the JR Takasaki Line and the Shonan-Shinjuku Line have resumed after being temporarily suspended. The JR Takasaki Line, running between Tokyo Station and Takasaki Station in Gunma Prefecture, and the Shonan-Shinjuku Line, which had suspended services north of Shinjuku, are now back in operation.

In weather news, a dangerous heatwave is expected in the inland areas of Kanto, with temperatures approaching 40 degrees Celsius. Due to the consecutive days of intense heat, there have been several cases of elderly individuals losing their lives. It is crucial to remain vigilant and take precautions against heatstroke.

Furthermore, there has been a train derailment at a level crossing in Fukaya, Saitama Prefecture, causing the suspension of train services on the JR Takasaki Line between Tokyo Station and Takasaki Station. As a result, the Shonan-Shinjuku Line is also suspended in both directions north of Shinjuku Station.

In other news, residents in the regions of Hokuriku, Niigata, and Tohoku are advised to be cautious as the stagnant seasonal rain front may cause unstable atmospheric conditions, leading to heavy rainfall, potential landslides, and flooding.

Additionally, a report on the helicopter collision accident involving two Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force helicopters off the Izu Islands in April has revealed the possibility of insufficient monitoring inside the helicopters and a lack of coordination between commanding officers giving instructions to the helicopters.

Lastly, in a tragic incident from two years ago, the former director of a certified daycare center in Makinohara, Shizuoka Prefecture, who was convicted of negligence resulting in the death of a 3-year-old girl left inside a school bus, has informed the girl's parents that they do not plan to appeal the one year and four months prison sentence for the charge of manslaughter due to professional negligence. And now for the weather. Today in Tokyo, the weather will be sunny with a maximum temperature of 35°C and a minimum temperature of 28°C. There is a 0% chance of rain and a UV index of 9.
