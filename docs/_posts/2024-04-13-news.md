Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on April 13th, 2024. In our first news story, a tragic accident occurred yesterday evening in Yachiyo-cho, Ibaraki Prefecture. A wagon car used for transporting users of a day service facility collided with a utility pole, resulting in the death of a 92-year-old woman who was using the facility and injuries to seven other individuals, including users and staff.

Moving on to our next story, a special subcommittee of the Central Council for Education has been discussing the salaries and working conditions of teachers. It has been revealed that the subcommittee is considering a proposal to increase teachers' monthly salaries by more than 10%, while maintaining the current framework of not paying overtime. This would be the first significant increase in over 50 years.

In other news, a symposium was held in Tokyo yesterday to discuss support for earthquake victims ahead of the eighth anniversary of the Kumamoto earthquake. Researchers from universities called for a revision of the laws regarding support for victims, emphasizing the need to incorporate welfare perspectives and avoid repeating the lack of welfare-focused support in past disasters.

Meanwhile, a Japanese restaurant in Hong Kong has started using ingredients from Ishikawa Prefecture to support the region that was affected by the Noto Peninsula earthquake. The restaurant is offering a menu that features seafood and other products from Ishikawa Prefecture.

Next, the issue of fraudulent advertisements on social media, where imposters impersonate celebrities to solicit investments, was discussed in a special committee meeting of the House of Councillors on the 12th. The Consumer Affairs Agency stated that current regulations on prize display do not cover impersonation advertisements. They expressed their intention to collaborate with relevant ministries and agencies to prevent fraud and other damages.

In the wake of the Noto Peninsula earthquake and subsequent fires, the Rikuzen-Asaichi morning market in Wajima City, Ishikawa Prefecture, which has been unable to operate, will now be held in various locations starting from today, the 13th.

Lastly, the Tokyo Metropolitan Waterworks Bureau has issued a warning about suspicious emails claiming to be from the bureau and requesting personal information, citing unpaid fees. Several inquiries have been received regarding these fraudulent emails, and the bureau is urging caution. And now for the weather. Today in Tokyo, the weather will be sunny with a high of 21°C and a low of 14°C.  Visit JapanDailyNews.com for the news, yen exchange rates, and a daily Japanese proverb.
