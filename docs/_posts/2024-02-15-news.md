Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on February 15th, 2024. In today's news, Japan Post has announced that it will resume accepting packages for Nanao City, Suzu City, Noto Town, and Anamizu Town in Ishikawa Prefecture, which were temporarily suspended due to the impact of the Noto Peninsula Earthquake. This decision will come into effect on the 15th of February, and certain post offices will be able to receive packages addressed to these areas.

Following the extensive damage caused by the Noto Peninsula Earthquake, a committee of experts convened for the first meeting of the national government to examine the relationship between the age of buildings, seismic standards, and the resulting damage. The committee aims to compile the results by autumn of this year.

In other news, a revised Criminal Procedure Act, which provides for the protection of information regarding victims of sexual crimes, will come into effect on the 15th of February. This amendment allows for the progression of criminal proceedings without disclosing the names of victims or other personal information to the suspects or defendants.

Moving on to weather, unseasonably warm temperatures are expected to continue in Tokyo, with a forecasted high of 20 degrees Celsius on the 15th. However, the Pacific side of Japan may experience unstable atmospheric conditions due to the influence of a front and low-pressure system. This could lead to severe gusts of wind, thunderstorms, and hail, so caution is advised.

In a visit to a hospital in Kanazawa on the 14th, Prince Akishino expressed his encouragement to the victims of the Noto Peninsula Earthquake who are currently hospitalized, as well as the medical professionals involved in their care.

The Liberal Democratic Party is considering holding a meeting of the Political Ethics Examination Committee in response to the issue surrounding factional political funding parties. However, one of the five members of the Abe faction has expressed reluctance to attend. Internal discussions within the party are expected to take place as no members have yet indicated their intention to attend.

Lastly, in an incident in Sagamihara City, a couple in their 50s were found dead in their apartment, and their 15-year-old son has been arrested on suspicion of killing his father. Police investigations have revealed multiple stab wounds on the father's body. It is believed that there may have been some kind of trouble between the father and son, and the police are currently investigating the details of the incident. And now for the weather. Today in Tokyo, the weather will be mostly sunny with a maximum temperature of 18°C and a minimum temperature of 11°C.
