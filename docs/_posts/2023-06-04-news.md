In Tokyo, the number of syphilis cases is increasing at a pace surpassing last year's record high, prompting the city to expand its testing system. The National Cancer Center has released a fact sheet summarizing the latest information on cervical cancer, including Japan's higher mortality rate from the disease compared to other advanced countries and the effectiveness and safety of HPV vaccines. In Hamamatsu, Shizuoka, one person was found dead in a collapsed house due to a landslide caused by record-breaking heavy rain. Their identity is being confirmed. Emperor and Empress of Japan attended the National Tree Planting Festival in Rikuzentakata, Iwate Prefecture, their first visit to a disaster-stricken area since ascending to the throne.

Manga artist Leiji Matsumoto's farewell ceremony was held in Tokyo on June 3rd, with about 3,000 people offering flowers. And now for the weather.
