Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on October 9th, 2023. In today's news, a tsunami warning has been issued for the Izu Islands, Ogasawara Islands, Chiba, and Kochi following an earthquake off the coast of Torishima in the Izu Islands. The Japan Meteorological Agency has announced a tsunami alert with an expected height of 1 meter. The tsunami has already reached the affected areas.

In other news, during a trail running event in Takayama, Gifu Prefecture, 42 participants were stung by bees. Fortunately, all the injuries were reported to be minor, and the affected individuals have been hospitalized for treatment.

Moving on to international news, the Taliban's interim government in Afghanistan has confirmed that over 2,000 people have died following a magnitude 6.3 earthquake in the western part of the country. Rescue operations are underway to save those trapped in collapsed buildings.

In a lighter news story, Emperor Naruhito and Empress Masako attended the fencing competition at the National Sports Festival in Kagoshima Prefecture.

Turning to the changing autumn season, there have been some unusual developments on the dinner table. The Sanma fish, a popular autumn delicacy, is experiencing a decline in catch due to poor fishing conditions. Additionally, the record-breaking heat has resulted in poor crop growth and other agricultural issues across the country.

Shifting our focus to health and fitness, a survey conducted by the Japan Sports Agency reveals a decline in physical and athletic abilities among males aged 6 to 19. Experts speculate that the restrictions on children's extracurricular activities, including sports clubs, during the COVID-19 pandemic may have contributed to this decline.

And finally, an update on transportation news. The Toei Shinjuku Line, which had temporarily suspended services between Iwamotocho and Motoyawata stations due to a balloon on the tracks at Morishita Station, has now resumed normal operations as of 5:40 PM.

That's all for today's news. Thank you for listening to Japan Daily News. Stay tuned for more updates.   And that's all for today's news. Thanks for listening to Japan Daily News.
