### Transcript

Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on July 31st, 2023. In our first news story, steam containing high levels of arsenic has flowed out of an excavation site in Ransetsu-cho, Hokkaido. The steam was detected with a high concentration of arsenic, and it has been discovered that approximately 10,000 liters of water containing the high concentration of arsenic, derived from the steam, has flowed outside the site.

Moving on to our next story, flights, especially those to and from Okinawa, have been disrupted due to the impact of a typhoon. The typhoon, Typhoon 6, is a large and strong typhoon that is expected to approach Okinawa and Amami significantly on August 1st. The area is expected to experience strong winds, heavy rain, and high waves, so please exercise caution and be prepared for severe weather conditions.

In other news, a 29-year-old man in Uji, Kyoto has been arrested for leaving his 3-year-old partner's son unattended in a bathtub, resulting in the child drowning and dying. The incident occurred in the early morning of July 30th. The suspect is now in custody.

Additionally, in Tokyo's Higashimurayama City, a couple in their 70s was found dead in their home. The cause of death is suspected to be heatstroke as there were no visible external injuries, and the indoor temperature was high at the time. The Metropolitan Police Department is investigating the details of the incident.

As the dangerous heat continues, it is important to remain vigilant against heatstroke. Today, temperatures are expected to reach a dangerous level of 38 degrees Celsius in many areas. Please continue to use air conditioning appropriately and stay hydrated even if you do not feel thirsty.

Lastly, the record-breaking heavy rainfall in northern Kyushu for the past three weeks has had a significant impact on the high-end jellyfish fishing industry in the Ariake Sea. Efforts are underway to remove large amounts of driftwood along the coast, and the jellyfish catch, which is a valuable source of income for fishermen, has been greatly reduced.

That concludes today's news report. Thank you for listening to Japan Daily News. And now for the weather. Today in Tokyo, the weather will be partly cloudy with a maximum temperature of 29°C and a minimum temperature of 28°C. There is a chance of light rain showers in the afternoon. The humidity will be around 80%.  And that's all for today's news. Thanks for listening to Japan Daily News.
