Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on July 22nd, 2024. In today's news, a powerful typhoon is expected to approach the Okinawa Islands on the 24th and 25th of July. Typhoon number 3, currently located east of the Philippines, is anticipated to intensify and move northward, posing a significant threat to the Okinawa Islands. The meteorological agency has issued an early warning for typhoon preparedness and has urged strict caution against strong winds and high waves.

Moving on to our next story, a collision and derailment occurred between two maintenance vehicles on the Tokaido Shinkansen in the early hours of the 22nd. One train operator sustained minor injuries. As a result, train services between Nagoya and Hamamatsu stations on the Tokaido Shinkansen line have been suspended. JR Tokai has not announced a timeframe for resuming operations.

In other news, dangerously hot temperatures are expected to exceed 38 degrees Celsius in the Kanto and Tokai regions. Please continue to take precautions against heatstroke by staying hydrated and replenishing electrolytes regularly.

The Japanese government has initiated a 24-hour monitoring program for the software of network devices in various government ministries and agencies to strengthen cybersecurity measures. This proactive approach aims to identify any vulnerable areas that may be prone to cyberattacks.

In preparation for the upcoming Aomori Nebuta Festival, the final stage of preparations, known as 'Taiage,' is underway in Aomori City. This involves placing large Nebuta floats onto carts.

In international news, a charity auction will be held featuring items donated by Japanese singers, actors, and other cultural figures to support children living in the Gaza Strip, who have been affected by ongoing attacks by the Israeli military.

Lastly, a man has been arrested on suspicion of murdering a male individual whose body was discovered in a Kyoto apartment back in June. The acquaintance, who was the first to report the incident to the police, denies the allegations during questioning. And now for the weather. Today in Tokyo, the weather will be sunny with a maximum temperature of 35°C and a minimum temperature of 27°C.
