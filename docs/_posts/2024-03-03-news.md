Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on March 3rd, 2024. In Tottori, two men are missing after being caught in an avalanche on Mount Daisen. The police have confirmed the situation at the scene and will resume the search. Meanwhile, the Tokyo Marathon has caused significant traffic restrictions in the city center. The Tokyo Metropolitan Police are urging people to avoid using cars and opt for public transportation instead.

Moving on to another news story, a Filipino couple has been arrested in Tokyo's Adachi Ward for the murder of a Japanese couple. The victims' wallets and cell phones were found in a nearby train station locker. The police suspect that the suspects took the items from the crime scene to delay the discovery of the crime.

In Miyazaki Prefecture, a magnitude 4 earthquake was observed, but there is no concern of a tsunami. Now, let's turn our attention to the Noto Peninsula earthquake survivor in Ishikawa Prefecture. Two months after losing his wife and daughter in the earthquake, the man expressed that nothing has changed for him. He still feels their presence and time seems to stand still.

In Nagano, all 10 people who were caught in an avalanche on Mount Fubuki have been confirmed safe. Two individuals were rescued without injuries, and the remaining eight were able to descend the mountain on their own.

Lastly, a lecture on women and disaster preparedness was held in Kofu City. A female representative from an NPO, who experienced the Great East Japan Earthquake, highlighted the importance of considering women's perspectives in emergency shelters, such as providing breastfeeding spaces and ensuring access to sanitary products. And now for the weather. Today in Tokyo, the weather will be partly cloudy with a high of 10°C and a low of 4°C. There is a 47% chance of overcast skies and no chance of rain or snow. The UV index is 4, indicating moderate sun exposure. Enjoy your day!  Visit JapanDailyNews.com for the news, yen exchange rates, and a daily Japanese proverb.
