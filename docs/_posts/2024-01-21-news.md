Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on January 21st, 2024. In today's news, we have two significant stories from Japan. First, the Kanto region and Noto Peninsula are bracing for heavy snowfall. Due to the influence of a low-pressure system moving south of Honshu, snow has been falling in northern Kanto and Nagano Prefecture. There is a possibility of heavy snowfall in the mountainous areas of Kanto throughout the day. The Japan Meteorological Agency is urging caution regarding the impact on transportation and the risk of icy road surfaces.

Moving on to our second story, the areas affected by the Noto Peninsula earthquake are experiencing continuous rainfall. The regions that experienced strong tremors are particularly vulnerable to landslides due to the loosened ground. Even light rainfall can trigger soil and mud disasters. Therefore, caution is advised in these areas.

In other news, a disturbing incident involving the abandonment of a couple's bodies has come to light in Tokyo's Adachi Ward. The investigation has revealed that a blood-stained knife was found at the scene. Both the husband and wife were found dead with stab wounds to their chests. The Metropolitan Police Department suspects that the knife was used as the murder weapon and is currently investigating the details of the case.

In an effort to prevent accidents where visually impaired individuals are left stranded on railroad crossings and are subsequently hit by trains, the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism has established new standards for the shape and placement of tactile paving blocks and other guidance indicators within the crossings. As a result, 319 crossings have been designated for improvement.

In a heartwarming development, Kanazawa City in Ishikawa Prefecture has decided to set up pet care spaces in evacuation centers to accommodate people who have been displaced by earthquakes and wish to bring their pets along.

Lastly, NHK Kanazawa will be providing simultaneous broadcasts of essential information related to the Noto Peninsula earthquake, including updates on the region's lifelines and local information.

That's all for today's news. Thank you for tuning in to Japan Daily News. Stay safe and have a great day! And now for the weather. Today in Tokyo, the weather will be light rain with a high of 12°C and a low of 7°C.  Visit JapanDailyNews.com for the news, yen exchange rates, and a daily Japanese proverb.
