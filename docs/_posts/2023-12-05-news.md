Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on December 5th, 2023. In the early morning of December 5th, a house fire occurred in Akita City, Akita Prefecture. The fire has resulted in the loss of contact with two individuals, including an elementary school student, from the family of five residing in the house. The police and fire department are currently conducting investigations to locate them.

Moving on to our next story, the appeal trial of the Chilean defendant in the case of the disappearance of a Japanese college student who was studying in France seven years ago took place on December 4th. The defendant, who had previously been sentenced to 28 years in prison for murder, once again claimed innocence during the trial.

Now, let's turn our attention to Tokyo, where the local government is aiming to expand support measures for child-rearing by working towards the substantial exemption of high school tuition fees. The current income restrictions are being considered for removal starting from the next fiscal year.

In other news, the Ministry of Justice has recognized the suicide of a male prosecutor from the Hiroshima District Public Prosecutor's Office four years ago as a 'work-related accident.' The decision was based on the circumstances of the prosecutor's overtime work, as revealed by the lawyer representing the bereaved family.

Shifting gears, the Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry is planning to request major IT companies, such as Apple and Amazon Japan, to improve the transparency of their business transactions. The ministry aims to encourage these companies to actively disclose standards regarding their handling of complaints and consultations from business partners, as well as fees.

Moving on, at the Yoshinogari Historical Park in Saga Prefecture, three artifacts believed to be among the oldest in Japan were discovered in an area previously shrouded in mystery. These artifacts, including a mold used in the production of bronze items during the middle Yayoi period, provide valuable insights into ancient craftsmanship.

Lastly, the 'Search Awards' ceremony, which honors individuals and works with the highest increase in search volume on major internet search engines, announced its winners. Shohei Ohtani, the Japanese baseball player who achieved great success in Major League Baseball and the World Baseball Classic, was awarded the grand prize. And now for the weather. Today in Tokyo, the weather will be partly cloudy with a maximum temperature of 12°C and a minimum temperature of 10°C.
