Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on July 23rd, 2023. In today's news, a heatwave is set to hit western Japan with temperatures exceeding 35 degrees Celsius. The high-pressure system covering western to northern Japan is expected to bring scorching heat, and extreme heat is likely to continue in some areas until the end of the month. Please remember to take frequent breaks and stay hydrated to prevent heatstroke.

Moving on to our next story, an outbreak of Classical Swine Fever (CSF), also known as pig fever, has been confirmed in a pig farm in Minamiawaji City, Hyogo Prefecture. As a result, approximately 650 pigs in the farm are being culled. CSF is a highly contagious viral disease that affects pigs, and it is necessary to take swift action to prevent its spread.

Next, we turn to the earthquake that occurred in Kochi Prefecture and Oita Prefecture. The earthquake, with a magnitude of 4, was felt in both prefectures but did not pose any tsunami threat. The tremors were recorded at 9:14 pm on the 22nd. Fortunately, no significant damage or injuries have been reported.

In Nagano City, a tragic incident took place along the Susukawa River. A 6-year-old boy, who had been unconscious since drowning in the river on the 17th of this month, sadly passed away on the morning of the 22nd. Our thoughts go out to the family during this difficult time.

Moving on, a concerning incident occurred at a kindergarten in Tokorozawa, Saitama Prefecture. It was discovered that a child was accidentally left behind on a school bus, which departed on a different route. Fortunately, the child's condition was not affected, and measures are being taken to prevent such incidents in the future.

In Hokkaido, Prince and Princess Akishino visited Atsuma Town, which was severely affected by the Eastern Iburi earthquake five years ago. They inspected the progress of the recovery efforts from the landslide disaster and observed the current state of the reconstruction. Their visit serves as a reminder of the ongoing challenges faced by the affected communities.

Lastly, in Goshogawara Town, Akita Prefecture, where water supply had been disrupted due to heavy rainfall, restoration work is underway. Despite the scorching heat, efforts are being made to restore water to the elderly care facility and ensure the well-being of the residents.
