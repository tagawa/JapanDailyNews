Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on September 16th, 2024. A recent survey by a research group from Tohoku University has revealed that about 70 percent of local governments in Japan do not have a defined period for the storage of unclaimed remains. As municipalities increasingly face cases where bodies go unclaimed due to lack of relatives or other reasons, some local governments choose to keep the ashes permanently, while others opt for disposal. Experts are urging the national government to establish guidelines that take into account local circumstances to avoid potential conflicts.

In weather news, Typhoon 14 has formed in the ocean far to the south of Japan and is expected to strengthen slightly as it approaches Okinawa and Amami by mid-week. The Japan Meteorological Agency is advising residents to stay alert for updates regarding this developing storm.

Meanwhile, the weather has turned unstable across the Sea of Japan in western Japan and eastern regions, with Shimane Prefecture experiencing record rainfall. The Meteorological Agency has issued warnings of exceptionally heavy rain, urging residents to take precautions for safety.

In Shimane, the city of Matsue has reported approximately 110 millimeters of rain in just one hour, leading to urgent warnings about the risk of disasters in the area. Residents are being advised to remain vigilant and prioritize their safety in light of the severe weather conditions.

Additionally, in Ishikawa Prefecture, the city of Suzu has issued evacuation orders for 102 households, totaling 153 individuals, in the Otani district due to heightened risks of landslides following recent rainfall and the seismic activity from the Noto Peninsula earthquake. This warning is classified as level four on a five-tier alert system, indicating a serious threat to safety.

On a different note, there have been reports of ongoing fraudulent activities involving stolen credit card information, even after victims have reported the theft and had their cards suspended. This appears to involve new methods that exploit smartphone tap-to-pay features. Card companies are actively working on countermeasures, and users are encouraged to take steps to protect themselves from such fraud. And now for the weather. Today in Tokyo, expect light rain showers with temperatures around 28 degrees Celsius and a high of 29 degrees, while the moon will be in a waxing gibbous phase.
