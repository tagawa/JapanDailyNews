Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on January 31st, 2024. In earthquake-hit areas such as the Noto region in Ishikawa Prefecture, the number of earthquakes is gradually decreasing, but the activity remains high, and caution is still necessary. During the day, temperatures are expected to reach levels similar to late March, leading to snowmelt. Due to the loosening of the ground caused by the earthquakes, there is a risk of landslides, so please be cautious. Moving on to our next story, three Japanese nationals in their 20s have been arrested by the Saitama Prefectural Police Headquarters for their involvement in a fraud case where elderly people were deceived of their cash while staying in Cambodia. Two other members of the same group, believed to be receivers, have also been arrested in Japan, as the police aim to uncover the truth behind the group. Now, let's move on to the next news item. In Ishikawa Prefecture, water supply support will be provided in eight cities and towns today. Turning our attention to the power situation, approximately 2,500 households in the Noto region of Ishikawa Prefecture are currently experiencing power outages as of 5:00 AM. Shifting gears to a different topic, last year saw a record number of incidents involving the leakage or loss of personal information from listed companies, reaching 175 cases and affecting 40.9 million individuals, according to a compilation by a credit research company. Finally, in regards to child custody after divorce, a subcommittee of the Legislative Council has compiled a draft outline that focuses on the introduction of 'joint parental authority' that grants both fathers and mothers custody of their children. The Ministry of Justice plans to submit a bill to amend the Civil Code and other laws in the current session of the Diet with the aim of enacting it. And now for the weather. Today in Tokyo, the weather will be partly cloudy with a high of 14°C and a low of 7°C.  Visit JapanDailyNews.com for the news, yen exchange rates, and a daily Japanese proverb.
