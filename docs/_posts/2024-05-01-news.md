Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on May 1st, 2024. In the aftermath of the Noto Peninsula earthquake, two female students from Ishikawa Prefecture shared their thoughts on the recovery as they prepared for university entrance exams in Kansai. Meanwhile, manufacturers are enhancing information sharing on the safety of supplements containing 'red koji' after the issue surrounding Kobayashi Pharmaceutical's product. Moving on to other news, the Tokyo Metropolitan Police have arrested two 20-year-old suspects in connection with the body abandonment case in Nasu Town, Tochigi Prefecture. The police believe they are the perpetrators responsible for damaging the bodies. The investigation into the incident is ongoing. On the topic of the Noto Peninsula earthquake, the Ministry of the Environment has notified local governments that they can apply for public funding for the demolition of collapsed houses on behalf of the owners, as obtaining consent from all owners has proven difficult. In another development related to the Nasu Town body abandonment case, the Tokyo Metropolitan Police have arrested another suspect, Yuto Wakayama, on suspicion of damaging the bodies. Shifting gears to Niigata City, which experienced liquefaction damage during the earthquake, a residents' briefing was held to provide updates on recovery progress and support measures. Lastly, it has been four months since the Noto Peninsula earthquake, and Toyama Prefecture has reported approximately 18,000 homes damaged. The focus now is on rebuilding homes and addressing liquefaction issues in the area. And now for the weather. Today in Tokyo, the weather will be cloudy with a maximum temperature of 20°C and a minimum temperature of 12°C. There is a chance of light drizzle and light rain throughout the day. The humidity will be around 82-87%.  Visit JapanDailyNews.com for the news, yen exchange rates, and a daily Japanese proverb.
