Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on October 3rd, 2024. Miyazaki Airport is set to resume normal operations after a significant incident on October 2nd. A bomb, which had been discovered buried on the runway, exploded, leading to temporary closure of the airport. Fortunately, four flights had already passed through the area before the explosion occurred, preventing what could have been a disastrous situation. Recovery efforts were completed by the evening of October 2nd, allowing flights to return to their regular schedules starting today.

In health news, there has been a concerning rise in misinformation about the HPV vaccine, which is critical for preventing cervical cancer. Experts are urging the public to rely on information from official sources when making decisions about vaccination, as social media platforms are rife with inaccuracies that could mislead potential recipients.

Shifting to law enforcement, a robbery and assault incident in Tokorozawa, Saitama Prefecture, has revealed troubling details. One of the suspects, believed to be part of a 'dark job' scheme, reported that they received instructions via an app to not flee the scene when they attempted to escape. This has raised suspicions about how tightly the orchestrators of the crime were controlling their actions.

Weather alerts are in effect for both western and eastern Japan as unstable atmospheric conditions are expected to persist until October 4th. The Japan Meteorological Agency has warned residents to be cautious of severe thunderstorms, lightning, and potential tornadoes.

Additionally, Typhoon Number 18 is approaching the Sakishima Islands in Okinawa, with expected impacts between October 3rd and 5th. Authorities are advising residents to be vigilant regarding high waves and possible landslides as the storm approaches.

In legislative news, the National Police Agency is working on amendments to the Entertainment Business Law to regulate 'scout back' payments in host clubs. This comes in response to cases where women, after being charged exorbitant fees, were coerced into sex work to repay debts.

Lastly, in a groundbreaking medical development, a group from Tokyo Medical University is planning Japan's first-ever surgery to transplant a pig kidney into a fetus suffering from severe kidney disease. They are set to submit a surgical plan for review on October 4th, with hopes to apply for official approval to perform the surgery by 2025. And now for the weather. Today in Tokyo, expect light rain with temperatures around 24 degrees Celsius and a high of 24 degrees, while the moon will be in a waxing crescent phase.
