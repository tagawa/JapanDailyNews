Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on August 26th, 2024. In today's news, we begin with a significant weather update as Typhoon 10 is set to approach western Japan and the Amami region starting tomorrow. The Japan Meteorological Agency has issued warnings for strong winds and heavy rainfall, urging residents to prepare before the storm arrives. It is crucial for everyone to finalize their preparations today to ensure safety against potential hazards such as landslides and flooding.

In other news, a fire broke out in Moji Ward of Kitakyushu early this morning, destroying around 50 cars that were parked for export. Fortunately, there were no injuries reported, but authorities are currently investigating the cause of the blaze.

Shifting our focus to education, a committee has issued recommendations regarding the transition of Chiba Science University to a public institution. The report outlines conditions for this transition, including a review of the university's scale and the transfer of operational funds from the school corporation to the city.

Meanwhile, in Tochigi Prefecture, a line of heavy rainfall has led to concerns about landslides and soil instability. The unstable atmospheric conditions have resulted in extreme weather, with reports of around 110 millimeters of rain falling in just one hour in the region. Residents are advised to remain vigilant as the ground continues to be at risk of collapse due to the recent heavy rains.

Lastly, the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism is stepping up efforts to enhance the earthquake resistance of water supply systems nationwide. This initiative comes in response to the prolonged water outages caused by the Noto Peninsula earthquake earlier this year, highlighting the urgent need for infrastructure improvements. And now for the weather. Today in Tokyo, it will be partly cloudy with a high of 32 degrees Celsius and a low of 27 degrees Celsius, feeling like 36 degrees due to humidity, and no chance of rain.
