Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on July 4th, 2024. Today's news brings us two significant stories from Japan.

First, a dangerous heatwave is expected to hit the Tokai region, with temperatures reaching up to 38 degrees Celsius. As the heat poses a risk of heatstroke, it is important to take precautions such as using air conditioning and staying hydrated.

In other news, the Supreme Court has ruled that the former Eugenic Protection Law, which allowed forced sterilizations based on disabilities, was unconstitutional. The court has ordered the government to compensate the victims and calls for the establishment of a comprehensive compensation system.

Moving on to other news, there has been a significant increase in the number of bankruptcies among caregiving businesses. In the first half of this year alone, 81 caregiving businesses have filed for bankruptcy, marking a record high.

It has been four years since the record-breaking heavy rainfall in Kumamoto, which claimed the lives of 67 people and left two missing. As the affected residents transition from temporary housing to disaster public housing, providing detailed support to help them rebuild their lives is a pressing issue.

In a separate story, the sister of Iwao Hakamada, who is currently undergoing a retrial for a murder case that took place 58 years ago, has expressed her thoughts on the prosecution's renewed request for the death penalty. She stated that she believes the prosecutors feel the need to seek the death penalty and that she remains unaffected by their actions.

In a shocking revelation, Kawasaki Heavy Industries has announced that it engaged in fictitious transactions during the repair of submarines commissioned by the Maritime Self-Defense Force. The company misappropriated the funds obtained from these transactions for unauthorized purposes such as dining and entertainment. The amount of money involved is estimated to be several billion yen, and the company has established a special investigation committee to conduct a thorough investigation.

Lastly, a serious accident occurred at a middle school in Kamii-shi, Toyama Prefecture. During a track and field practice, a coach threw a shot put that struck a first-year student, causing a severe head injury. The incident has raised concerns about safety management, and the local education board is investigating the details.

That concludes today's news report from Japan Daily News. Thank you for listening. And now for the weather. Today in Tokyo, the weather will be mostly sunny with a maximum temperature of 33°C and a minimum temperature of 26°C. There is a 97% chance of high temperatures and an 85% chance of dry conditions. The UV index is 10, indicating very high UV levels. Enjoy the day!  Visit JapanDailyNews.com for the news, yen exchange rates, and a daily Japanese proverb.
