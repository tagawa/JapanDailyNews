Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on May 21st, 2024. In Tokyo, there was a temporary flooding at an intersection in the Chiyoda ward this morning. The area was flooded as a result of a burst water pipe, causing the police to implement traffic restrictions. The exact cause is currently under investigation.

Moving on to Okinawa, the city of Miyakojima issued evacuation advisories for four school districts due to heavy rain. The advisories were issued for the Hiraichi, Kita, Minami, and Kumatsu districts. Elderly individuals and those with disabilities were urged to evacuate as a precautionary measure. The city is currently at alert level 3, emphasizing the importance of early evacuation.

In other news, a preserved specimen of the Japanese wolf, the fourth one found in the country, will be publicly displayed for the first time at the National Museum of Science in Tokyo. The specimen was discovered by a middle school student in the museum's storage room.

The Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism has launched a website that provides comprehensive information on land prices, flood-prone areas, and local population data. The site aims to assist individuals in making informed decisions regarding relocation and real estate transactions.

In a separate development, a gun seized from a hideout in Sendai, where a 55-year-old member of the 'Kizuna-kai' organized crime group was hiding, is suspected to have been used in a murder case in Kobe last year. The gun is believed to be connected to the killing of a gang leader at a ramen shop. The police plan to arrest the organized crime group member on suspicion of involvement in the Kobe incident.

As the jury system in Japan reaches its 15th year, the Supreme Court has revealed that approximately one-third of jury candidates have been absent without permission during the selection process. Last year, the attendance rate was recorded at 68.6%. The jury system, which allows ordinary citizens to participate in criminal trials, was introduced in May 2009, and over 124,000 people have served as jurors or supplementary jurors as of the end of February this year.

Lastly, in Oita Prefecture, the Ayu fishing season was opened in the Chikugo River system, making it the earliest opening in Kyushu. Many people eagerly gathered along the Kusu River to enjoy fishing since the early morning. And now for the weather. Today in Tokyo, the weather will be partly cloudy with a maximum temperature of 26°C and a minimum temperature of 19°C. There is a chance of light rain showers in the evening.
