Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on January 10th, 2024. In Hiroshima, a house fire broke out this morning, leaving two people in critical condition and three others injured. The fire department and police are investigating the incident. Meanwhile, the Noto Peninsula earthquake, which occurred last week, is still causing disruptions in the region. The JR Nanao Line, connecting Tsuhata Station and Wakura Onsen Station in Ishikawa Prefecture, remains closed in certain sections due to the earthquake damage. Additionally, the severe cold weather in the earthquake-affected areas has raised concerns about potential landslides. The Meteorological Agency is urging caution. In Niigata, the city is conducting an emergency assessment of the 'Former Sasakawa Family Residence,' a designated national important cultural property, to determine if there is any risk of collapse following the earthquake. Finally, despite the rising cost of living, real wages in Japan have decreased by 3% compared to the same month last year, marking the 20th consecutive month of decline. The cash earnings, however, have continued to increase for the 23rd consecutive month, although the wage growth has not kept up with the rising prices. And now for the weather. Today in Tokyo, the weather will be clear with a maximum temperature of 11°C and a minimum temperature of 6°C. The average temperature will be 9°C. There is a 0% chance of rain and a 86% chance of sunshine. The wind speed will be around 8 km/h. Enjoy your day!
