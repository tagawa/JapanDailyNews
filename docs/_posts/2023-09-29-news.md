### Transcript

Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on September 29th, 2023. In today's news, we have several stories from Japan. First, the job openings ratio for August remained steady at 1.29, the same level as July. The Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare is closely monitoring the situation due to a relatively large increase in new job postings. Moving on, consultations regarding hair removal services have surged, with over 60% of the cases involving individuals below the age of 20. The Tokyo Metropolitan Government's Consumer Affairs Center is urging young people to carefully review the terms of their contracts. 

Next, in response to multiple cases of suspected heatstroke at a music event held at Chiba City's ZOZO Marine Stadium in August, the city has decided to allow the consumption of sports drinks and other beverages on the stadium grounds under certain conditions, which were previously prohibited. 

In Fukushima's Iwaki City, the national treasure, Shiro Mizu Amida Hall, which was flooded during the record-breaking heavy rain earlier this month, will reopen for public viewing on October 1st. The removal of mud from the temple grounds has progressed, allowing visitors to once again appreciate its beauty. 

The National Police Agency will introduce a new system that utilizes artificial intelligence (AI) for cyber patrols starting from today. This system will automatically extract high-risk information and posts from the vast amount of data on the internet and social media platforms, aiming to expedite the detection of harmful content and contribute to crime prevention. 

In an effort to promote the reuse of PET bottles, Toyota Motor Corporation has partnered with eight material manufacturers to utilize recycled PET materials in the seats of some of their new car models, which will be released next year. This initiative aims to contribute to environmental sustainability. 

Lastly, two volunteer nurses from Okayama City, who participated in relief activities in the earthquake-stricken areas of central Morocco on September 8th, shared their experiences and the current situation in the affected areas. They highlighted the challenges faced in the reconstruction of lives and infrastructure. That's all for today's news from Japan. Stay tuned for more updates tomorrow. And now for the weather. Today in Tokyo, the weather will be mostly clear with a chance of patchy rain in the afternoon. The temperature will reach a high of 27°C (80°F) and a low of 26°C (79°F).  And that's all for today's news. Thanks for listening to Japan Daily News.
