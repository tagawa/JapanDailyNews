Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on January 5th, 2024. In today's news, renowned photographer Shinoyama Kishin has passed away at the age of 83. Shinoyama was known for capturing portraits of iconic figures that symbolized the era. Moving on to transportation news, the Seibu Haidama Line, which had suspended operations due to a level crossing accident, has resumed service between Tamagawa Josui and Haidama stations. Now, let's turn our attention to a disturbing incident in Chiba Prefecture. A 74-year-old suspect has been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after allegedly intentionally colliding with a motorcycle driven by a neighbor in front of their home. The suspect denies the allegations. Shifting gears, the effects of the Noto Peninsula earthquake are still being felt in Niigata City's Nishi Ward. More than 50 locations have experienced liquefaction, prompting the local social welfare council to start recruiting volunteers to assist with the removal of debris and other tasks requested by residents. Returning to transportation news, the Seibu Haidama Line is once again facing disruptions. This time, it's due to a collision between a truck and a train at a level crossing in Tokyo's Akishima City. Service between Tamagawa Josui and Haidama stations has been suspended since early morning, with no timetable for resumption. Now, let's provide an update on the situation in Ishikawa Prefecture, where the effects of the recent earthquake continue to impact daily life. Many areas are still experiencing water and power outages. We will keep you informed of the latest developments throughout the day. Finally, we have unfortunate news from Chiba Prefecture, where multiple residential fires have occurred, resulting in one fatality. Additionally, one resident is currently unaccounted for. Authorities are working to gather more information about these incidents. And now for the weather. Today in Tokyo, the weather will be partly cloudy with a high of 13°C and a low of 7°C. There is a 42% chance of overcast skies and a UV index of 2.  Visit JapanDailyNews.com for the news, yen exchange rates, and a daily Japanese proverb.
