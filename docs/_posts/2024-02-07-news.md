Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on February 7th, 2024. In today's news, train services on the JR Joban Line have resumed between Abiko Station in Chiba Prefecture and Toride Station in Ibaraki Prefecture. The services were temporarily suspended due to door inspections on the station platforms. Meanwhile, the Tsukuba Express, which had suspended operations on its entire line due to a power outage at its depot, has also resumed services.

Moving on to the weather, the Kanto and Koshin regions continue to experience severe cold temperatures. The recent heavy snowfall has left some areas with remaining snow and frozen roads, leading to the risk of falls and potential disruptions in traffic. Please exercise caution when traveling.

In other news, the earthquake in Ishikawa Prefecture has caused transportation disruptions. The exact impact on railways, aviation, buses, and roads is still being assessed. Additionally, power outages persist in the Noto region of Ishikawa Prefecture, with approximately 1,700 households affected.

The Civil Engineering Society held a press conference to discuss their findings from a survey conducted in the disaster-affected areas of the Noto Peninsula earthquake. They emphasized the importance of preparedness for complex disasters that involve not only building collapses but also tsunamis and fires occurring simultaneously.

That's all for today's news. Thank you for listening to Japan Daily News. And now for the weather. Today in Tokyo, the weather will be partly cloudy with a maximum temperature of 9°C and a minimum temperature of 4°C. There is a 46% chance of overcast skies and a 0% chance of rain. The average temperature for the day will be 7°C.  Visit JapanDailyNews.com for the news, yen exchange rates, and a daily Japanese proverb.
