Hello and welcome to Japan Daily News on May 11, 2023. Here are today's headlines:

In earthquake news, there were several incidents reported. A woman in Yokohama fell in her home and was injured, while others in Chiba prefecture were also hospitalized due to falling. Additionally, there was a strong earthquake with a magnitude of 5.0 in Kisarazu, Chiba prefecture, but there was no risk of a tsunami.

A recent survey of free schools revealed that 58% of respondents said that children were unable to join due to economic reasons. This highlights the challenges of ensuring educational opportunities for all, especially with the increasing number of students dropping out of school.

In the aftermath of the May 5th earthquake, the number of damaged houses in Suzu City, Ishikawa Prefecture has risen to 540. The investigation into the extent of the damage is ongoing.

Two Chinese Coast Guard vessels entered Japanese territorial waters near the Senkaku Islands in response to the movements of two Japanese fishing boats. The Japan Coast Guard has issued warnings for them to leave the area.

Some train services, including the JR Uchibo Line, have been suspended due to the earthquake, but most trains are operating normally. There are some delays on the Keikyu Line.

A rare video of a Japanese bird called the Shimaenaga has been captured in Kushiro City, Hokkaido. The footage shows the bird attacking its own reflection in a mirror, mistaking it for another bird.

Finally, the Japanese government's pandemic response task force, including Chairman Shigeru Omi, has published a record of their actions during the COVID-19 outbreak. This information is intended to be used as a reference for future pandemics. And that's all for today's news. Thanks for listening to Japan Daily News.
