Welcome to Japan Daily News on April 22, 2023. Here are today's headlines:

First, there has been a temporary suspension of the Tokaido Shinkansen due to a person entering the tracks between Okayama and Nagoya stations. The suspension affects the upbound trains from Okayama to Nagoya and the downbound trains from Hamamatsu to Maibara. The train operator, JR Tokai, has announced that the suspension is expected to end at 8 AM after the inspection of the tracks by the staff.

Next, Tokyo Metropolitan Bureau of Transportation has started a rental service for baby strollers at subway stations in collaboration with a private company. This service is the first of its kind in Japan and aims to provide peace of mind to parents with young children who use the subway.

In other news, the Japanese Air Self-Defense Force has dispatched three transport planes to Djibouti to prepare for the evacuation of Japanese nationals from Sudan. The planes are expected to arrive in Djibouti from Japan on the 23rd of April.

Moving on, a book about the experiences of Emperor Naruhito during his studies in the UK has been republished after 30 years. The book includes a new afterword in which the Emperor and Empress express their desire to visit the UK again.

According to a survey conducted by industry groups, the damage caused by piracy websites to Japanese content such as anime and manga has increased five times in the past four years, amounting to an estimated two trillion yen.

Lastly, the police are investigating an incident in Hino, Tokyo, where two women in their 70s were injured by a man with a knife. One of the victims reported that she was attacked by her brother, indicating a possible family feud. The police are searching for the suspect who fled the scene.
