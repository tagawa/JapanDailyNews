Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on November 23rd, 2023. In today's news, the depreciation of the yen is having an impact on students studying abroad. Some students are unable to afford the costs and have had to give up on their plans or shorten their study periods. Moving on, a winter storm warning has been issued for northern Japan, particularly the Japan Sea side, starting from the 24th. The atmospheric conditions are expected to become highly unstable, with the possibility of thunderstorms and gusty winds. It is advised to take precautions and be prepared for heavy snowfall from the 24th to the 25th. In other news, the Labor Standards Inspection Office has conducted an on-site investigation into the death of a member of the Takarazuka Revue. The investigation aims to determine if there were any violations of labor regulations. Shifting our focus, four individuals have been arrested for illegally selling over-the-counter drugs, including some that were suspected to have been stolen from pharmacies. The suspects were selling the drugs at about half the regular price in the 'Toyo Yokochō' area in Kabukichō, Shinjuku. The Metropolitan Police Department is investigating the details of the case. Additionally, the Tokyo District Public Prosecutors' Office Special Investigation Department has conducted new searches at the homes of two ward councilors in the Kōtō ward of Tokyo. This is in relation to the violation of the Public Offices Election Act surrounding the mayoral election held in April. The two councilors, who have acknowledged the searches, deny any wrongdoing. The Special Investigation Department is expected to continue its efforts to clarify the purpose of the cash they received. Shifting gears, Japan University's board of directors has recommended the resignation of President Takeo Sakai and Vice President Yasuhiro Sawada in response to the handling of the drug scandal involving the university's American football team. Furthermore, it has been decided that Chairperson Mariko Hayashi will have her salary reduced by 50%. Lastly, the Yamanashi Prefecture has held its first explanatory meeting for local residents regarding the 'Mount Fuji Climbing Railway Plan,' which is currently under consideration. The meeting took place in the mountain village of Yamanakako on the 21st. And now for the weather. Today in Tokyo, the weather will be mostly clear with a high of 20°C and a low of 15°C. There is a 68% chance of rain in the morning, but it will be sunny in the afternoon. The UV index is 5, so don't forget to wear sunscreen!
