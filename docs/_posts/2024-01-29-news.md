Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on January 29th, 2024. In our first news story, a person claiming to be Kirishima Satoshi, a member of the 'East Asia Anti-Japan Armed Front' wanted for his involvement in a series of bombings in the 1970s, has been confirmed dead in a hospital in Kanagawa Prefecture. Kirishima, who was suffering from stomach cancer, had been hospitalized since the beginning of this year, and the Tokyo Metropolitan Police had been rushing to confirm his identity through DNA testing.

Moving on to our next story, it has been four weeks since the Noto Peninsula earthquake occurred. In Niigata Prefecture, the damage from liquefaction has been significant, especially in Niigata City, where the investigation for issuing disaster certificates, necessary for receiving support, is expected to be delayed until February. This means that it will take some time to fully understand the extent of the damage.

Shifting gears, let's talk about the Kashiwazaki-Kariwa Nuclear Power Plant in Niigata. Following a series of security issues, the Nuclear Regulation Authority has effectively lifted the ban on its operation. In response, Tokyo Electric Power Company held an explanatory meeting in Kariwa Village, where participants raised questions about evacuation measures in light of the Noto Peninsula earthquake.

In other news, there will be water supply and bathing support provided in nine cities and towns in Ishikawa Prefecture today. Additionally, there have been transportation disruptions, including highways, railways, buses, and air travel, due to the earthquake.

As we approach the one-month mark since the Noto Peninsula earthquake, the situation in Ishikawa Prefecture remains challenging. With over 42,000 households still experiencing water shortages and slow infrastructure recovery, it is inevitable that the evacuation period will be prolonged.

Lastly, Tokyo University of Agriculture, which has been fostering a relationship with Wajima City in Ishikawa Prefecture through student research, held a support event for the Noto Peninsula earthquake. Graduates and students living in Wajima City came together to rally for support and aid in the recovery efforts. And now for the weather. Today in Tokyo, the weather will be mostly sunny with a high of 9°C and a low of 5°C.  Visit JapanDailyNews.com for the news, yen exchange rates, and a daily Japanese proverb.
