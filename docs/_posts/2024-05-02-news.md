Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on May 2nd, 2024. In today's news, there are several significant stories coming out of Japan.

First, there is a growing trend of using artificial intelligence (AI) to monitor children in nurseries and support local government initiatives for childcare. This move is expected to improve efficiency and bridge the gap in experience-based responses. Experts suggest that AI should be used as a tool to enhance support for children and families, creating a system where human involvement is still crucial.

Next, there has been an increase in the number of cases of 'Group A Streptococcal Pharyngitis,' a condition primarily affecting children and causing symptoms such as fever and sore throat. Experts are urging caution due to the higher than usual number of cases.

Shifting gears, last year saw a record number of foreign travelers at Narita Airport, with over 17.89 million people passing through. This surge can be attributed to the weakening yen and other factors.

In a criminal case in Tochigi Prefecture, a suspect believed to be the 'mastermind' behind the disposal of bodies was captured on a surveillance camera near a vacant house where the victims were allegedly assaulted. The Metropolitan Police Department is investigating why the suspect was in the vicinity and the details surrounding the incident.

Continuing with the same case, it has been revealed that the intermediary suspect received compensation from the 'mastermind' and passed it on to the 'executor.' Approximately 10 million yen was seized from the suspect's associates. The police suspect that both individuals were involved in the crime for monetary gain.

Moving on, there is a growing trend of businesses providing employment opportunities for individuals with disabilities through outsourcing services. While this helps secure job opportunities for people with disabilities, concerns have been raised about the lack of personal growth and independence. The Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare is advising companies to avoid using these services solely to achieve employment rate goals and instead focus on meaningful inclusion.

Lastly, a tragic incident occurred in Iwakuni, Yamaguchi, where a house fire claimed the lives of a couple in their 70s. Authorities have been unable to contact the residents and are investigating the circumstances surrounding the fire.

That concludes today's news report. Stay tuned for more updates from Japan Daily News. And now for the weather. Today in Tokyo, the weather will be partly cloudy with a high of 20°C and a low of 11°C. There is a chance of light rain showers throughout the day.
