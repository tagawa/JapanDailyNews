Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on August 23rd, 2024. Today, Japan is experiencing extreme heat, particularly in eastern and western regions, with temperatures already exceeding 35 degrees Celsius in some areas. This afternoon, there are warnings that temperatures could approach 40 degrees, prompting officials to urge everyone to take precautions against heat-related illnesses. In other news, the Tokyu Setagaya Line has resumed operations after conducting safety checks at a crossing between Nishi-Taishido and Wakabayashi stations. Earlier this morning, services were temporarily halted. Similarly, the Sotetsu Line also resumed service at around 9 a.m. following a personal injury incident that had caused delays since just after 7 a.m. In Shizuoka City, evacuation orders for parts of Suruga and Shimizu wards have been lifted. This decision affects over 3,500 residents, as the risk of landslides has decreased following heavy rainfall. Lastly, the JR Keiyo Line has reopened after a brief service suspension for vehicle inspections between Chiba Minato and Soga stations. And now for the weather. The weather in Tokyo today is not available.  Visit JapanDailyNews.com for the news, yen exchange rates, and a daily Japanese proverb.
