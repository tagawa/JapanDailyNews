### Transcript

Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on September 28th, 2023. In today's news, we have two significant stories from Japan.

First, an unexpected heatwave is forecasted in eastern and central Japan. Temperatures are expected to rise above 35 degrees Celsius, reaching heatwave levels in places like Tokai and Kanto-Koshin. This unseasonable heat calls for caution against heatstroke, so please take necessary precautions.

Moving on to our second story, victims of Minamata disease are seeking early relief. More than 120 people living in Kansai and other areas, who were not recognized as Minamata disease sufferers and were not eligible for special relief under the Special Measures Act, have filed a lawsuit against the government, Kumamoto Prefecture, and the responsible companies. On the 27th, the Osaka District Court recognized all the plaintiffs as Minamata disease victims and ordered the government and others to pay approximately 350 million yen in compensation. On the 28th, the plaintiffs visited the Ministry of the Environment to seek concrete discussions for the early relief of those still suffering from Minamata disease.

These were the top stories for today. Stay tuned for more news from Japan on Japan Daily News. And now for the weather. The weather in Tokyo today is partly cloudy with a high of 27°C.  And that's all for today's news. Thanks for listening to Japan Daily News.
