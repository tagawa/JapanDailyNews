Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on January 27th, 2024. In today's news, we have two significant stories from Japan.

First, in Ishikawa Prefecture, water supply support is scheduled to be implemented in nine cities and towns, including the city of Wajima. This support is planned for today, January 27th. The region has been affected by recent earthquakes, which have caused disruptions to transportation and infrastructure. As a result, the local authorities are taking steps to ensure a stable water supply for the affected areas.

Moving on to Tokyo, the government is aiming to digitalize parenting support measures by the fiscal year after next. The Tokyo Metropolitan Government plans to notify smartphone users about various parenting support measures based on their child's age and provide online administrative services that can be accessed using the My Number Card. This initiative aims to make it easier for parents to access and utilize government services related to child-rearing.

That's all for today's news. Stay tuned for more updates from Japan Daily News. And now for the weather. Today in Tokyo, the weather will be mostly clear with temperatures ranging from 4 to 10 degrees Celsius.  Visit JapanDailyNews.com for the news, yen exchange rates, and a daily Japanese proverb.
