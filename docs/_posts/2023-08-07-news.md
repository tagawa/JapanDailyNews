### Transcript

Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on August 7th, 2023. Typhoon 6 is moving eastward, bringing strong winds to the Amami region of Kagoshima Prefecture and other areas. There is a possibility of a 'linear precipitation band' forming in southern Kyushu and the Amami region, with successive development of cumulonimbus clouds from the morning of the 8th. Vigilance is required, and it is recommended to check hazard maps even in areas away from the typhoon, as there is a possibility of record-breaking heavy rainfall exceeding one month's worth of average rainfall for this time of year in western and eastern Japan's Pacific side from around Thursday, the 10th.

In response to postings on the internet regarding 'dark part-time jobs,' the National Police Agency has decided to include requests for deletion of posts recruiting 'executioners' for special fraud and drug smuggling, using terms such as 'decoy' and 'carrier,' as targets for site administrators to remove.

More than half of the respondents to a survey conducted by the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare regarding the 'HPV vaccine' for preventing cervical cancer and other diseases stated that they felt they did not have enough information to decide whether or not to receive the vaccine. The active promotion of vaccination was temporarily suspended due to reports of people experiencing physical pain, but it resumed last year after confirming its safety. The Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare is focusing on raising awareness of the vaccine.

The intense heat is expected to continue on the 7th, with temperatures rising in a wide area, particularly on the Sea of Japan side from Tohoku to the Chugoku region, where temperatures above 35 degrees Celsius are expected. Please continue to be cautious about heatstroke, even indoors, by using air conditioning properly.

A fire broke out on the evening of the 6th, completely destroying a residential building in Kurume City, Fukuoka Prefecture, which also housed a printing company. Two people were killed in the fire.

In the evening of the 6th, a teenage male was stabbed in the leg by an unknown person with a knife-like object on the streets of Nakano Ward, Tokyo. He was transported to the hospital. The Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department is investigating the incident as a case of assault.

An earthquake with a seismic intensity of 3 was observed in Kagoshima and Miyazaki prefectures at around 3:12 am on the 7th. Another earthquake with a seismic intensity of 3 was observed in Kagoshima Prefecture at around 3:32 am. There is no concern for a tsunami caused by these earthquakes. And now for the weather. Today in Tokyo, there will be patchy rain possible with temperatures around 28 degrees Celsius.  And that's all for today's news. Thanks for listening to Japan Daily News.
