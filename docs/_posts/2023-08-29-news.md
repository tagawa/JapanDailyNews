### Transcript

Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on August 29th, 2023. In today's news, we have two significant stories. First, Typhoon 9, a very strong typhoon, is currently moving northward east of the Philippines. There is a possibility of rough seas and high waves in the Okinawa Prefecture's remote islands from the 30th onwards, so residents are advised to exercise caution. On the other hand, Typhoon 11 is heading westward far south of Japan and may approach the Okinawa region from the 31st onwards. Stay tuned for the latest updates on this. Moving on to our second story, a major earthquake with a magnitude of 7.1 originated in the Bali Sea near Indonesia. The Japan Meteorological Agency has confirmed that there is no risk of a tsunami. Shifting gears, let's talk about a heartwarming event at a hearing-impaired support school in Akita City. A Japanese monkey named Aichan, who can perform using sign language, delighted the students and teachers with its impressive skills. Now, turning to a business-related news story, it has come to light that the president of Sompo Japan Insurance, Mr. Yoshiichi Shirakawa, had urged the resumption of business dealings with Big Motor, despite having received information about the possibility of fraudulent insurance claims last July. The Financial Services Agency is now investigating the details of the board meeting, where other executives, including the vice president, also stated that additional investigations were unnecessary. In international news, the Japanese Embassy in Beijing experienced an incident when bricks were thrown into its premises. This occurred on the same day that the release of diluted treated water from the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant into the sea began on the 24th of this month. Fortunately, there were no damages to the embassy staff or facilities, and a Chinese national has been apprehended by the police. Shifting our focus to education, it has been revealed that over 60% of local governments still leave the management of school accounting, including the collection of school lunch fees, to the schools themselves, despite the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology's request for local governments to handle these tasks. The ministry plans to urgently request improvements in this area. Lastly, in sports news, the Kanto Student American Football League is set to begin in September, and coaches and officials from various teams held a press conference. They discussed the recent arrest of a member of Nihon University's team for possessing marijuana and stimulant drugs, expressing mixed feelings and hoping for a swift return to the right path for the individual. That's all for today's news. Thank you for joining us on Japan Daily News. Stay safe and have a great day! And now for the weather. Today in Tokyo, it will be partly cloudy with a high of 28°C and a low of 27°C.  And that's all for today's news. Thanks for listening to Japan Daily News.
