Moving on to weather news, the Japan Sea side of Tohoku, including Yamagata and Akita prefectures, is expected to experience heavy rainfall once again from Tuesday, the 30th. Intense rain is forecasted to fall intermittently. In areas where river embankments have been damaged and the ground has become loose due to the record-breaking heavy rain, even a small amount of rain can increase the risk of disasters.

In Saitama and Ibaraki prefectures, more than 7,000 households are currently experiencing power outages. As of 10 PM, there were approximately 4,000 households without electricity in cities such as Ageo and Kasukabe in Saitama Prefecture, and about 3,000 households without power in Ibaraki Prefecture.

In Yamagata Prefecture, where record-breaking heavy rain has fallen, the identity of a deceased man found near Shinjo city has been confirmed as a 26-year-old sergeant who had been reported missing. However, another man in his 20s, who is a sergeant major, is still missing. The police and other authorities are continuing the search.

Lastly, according to the Tokyo Fire Department, a total of 120 people, ranging in age from 6 to 96, were transported to the hospital due to suspected heatstroke in Tokyo on the 27th until 9 PM. Please take precautions and stay hydrated during the hot summer weather.
