Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on May 5th, 2024. In today's news, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare is considering making the performance of corporate pensions above a certain scale public. The aim is to compare the performance with other companies and improve efficiency in generating profits. Moving on to our next story, a forest fire in Nanyo City, Yamagata Prefecture, has been burning for three days now. Firefighting efforts have been underway since the morning of the sixth day using helicopters. Evacuation orders have been issued to two districts due to the risk of the fire spreading to nearby homes. Now let's turn our attention to other news. During the Golden Week holidays, various events for children have been held across the country. In Yokohama, children had the opportunity to experience programming, which is currently popular, and play with robots. Shifting gears, a fire broke out in a yard in Suzuka, Mie Prefecture, where waste materials and cars are stored. The fire burned for about four hours. In another incident, the body of a man was found in Lake Akan, Hokkaido. He was one of the two men who went missing after a boating accident. The police are continuing their investigation to locate the other missing person and determine the circumstances of the accident. Lastly, a film of a domestically produced animation from about 100 years ago has been discovered. It was created by a daily goods manufacturer that sold toothbrushes and other products to promote dental health. Experts consider this film to be a valuable clue to understanding domestically produced anime from that era. And now for the weather. Today in Tokyo, the weather will be partly cloudy with a maximum temperature of 22°C and a minimum temperature of 19°C. There is a 19% chance of sunshine and a 0% chance of rain. The wind will be blowing from the south-southwest at a speed of 34 km/h.  Visit JapanDailyNews.com for the news, yen exchange rates, and a daily Japanese proverb.
