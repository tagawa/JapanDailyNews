Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on May 5th, 2024. In our first news story, a forest fire has been raging in Yamagata City since May 4th, with the fire spreading overnight and firefighters and the Self-Defense Forces continuing their efforts to extinguish it. Unfortunately, one person has suffered burns to their leg. Moving on to our second story, in response to the issue of missing foreign students at a university in Tokyo, the government has amended the ministerial ordinance to deny residency status for international students if the educational institution's management system is deemed insufficient. The government aims to ensure a stable acceptance of international students by thoroughly improving the management system. Now, let's turn our attention to Brazil, where heavy rain has been causing havoc in the southern region. Flooding and landslides have resulted in the deaths of 47 people, with over 60 individuals still missing. Our next story takes us to Kobe, where a man sustained a serious head injury, including a fractured skull, during a danjiri event. The man was trapped between the danjiri, a traditional wooden float, and suffered the injury. Shifting gears, the families of Japanese citizens abducted by North Korea have returned from their visit to the United States. They expressed their gratitude for the understanding and support received from the US government and Congress regarding the abduction issue. They urged the Japanese government to continue their efforts without compromising on the demand for the repatriation of all the victims. As temperatures rise across the country, we need to be cautious of heatstroke. On May 4th, many regions from Tohoku to western Japan experienced temperatures exceeding 30 degrees Celsius, marking the arrival of early summer. The heat is expected to intensify on May 5th, so it's important to take precautions against heatstroke. Lastly, in Tokyo's Ginza district, an event was held to showcase the planned conversion of the rooftop section of a building's highway into a pedestrian-centered public space. As a demonstration, the highway was temporarily opened to pedestrians. That's all for today's news. Thank you for tuning in to Japan Daily News. And now for the weather. Today in Tokyo, the weather will be sunny with a high of 25°C and a low of 19°C.  Visit JapanDailyNews.com for the news, yen exchange rates, and a daily Japanese proverb.
