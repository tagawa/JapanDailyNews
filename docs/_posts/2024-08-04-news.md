Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on August 4th, 2024. In today's news, a dangerous heatwave is expected in Kyushu as temperatures approach 40 degrees Celsius. It is advised to avoid going out or engaging in physical activities to prevent heatstroke. In other news, a suspect of a robbery in Nikko, Tochigi Prefecture, attempted to escape by breaking the ceiling in the police station where he was being held. Moving on, an 81-year-old man was found dead in a field in Kobe, and it is suspected to be a case of heatstroke. In Fukui, a 10-year-old boy suffered a severe injury to his hand after being bitten by a wild dolphin while swimming at a beach. Similar incidents have been reported in the area, prompting authorities to issue warnings. Shifting gears, the annual fireworks festival in Itabashi, Tokyo, took place for the first time since a fire incident occurred last year. The event implemented safety measures, including reducing the scale of the fireworks display. Additionally, astronomers are anticipating a rare celestial event known as a 'new star' explosion in the constellation Corona Borealis, which is visible in the summer night sky along with the Milky Way and the Summer Triangle. Finally, a woman in her 90s was found dead on a road in Tottori, and heatstroke is suspected as the cause. That wraps up today's news from Japan Daily News. And now for the weather. Today in Tokyo, the weather will be partly cloudy with a high of 34°C and a low of 27°C. There is a 99% chance of high temperatures and a 74% chance of sunshine. The UV index is 10, indicating very high UV levels. Overall, it will be a hot and sunny day with a slight chance of overcast skies.
