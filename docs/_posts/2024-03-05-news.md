Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on March 5th, 2024. In a shocking incident that took place in Nara City two years ago, former Prime Minister Abe was shot. Today, the defense team of the accused, Tetsuya Yamagami, who has been charged with murder and other crimes, provided an update on his current situation. They revealed that Yamagami constantly thinks about the incident and its impact. Moving on to international news, the US government held a ceremony at the White House to honor individuals who have contributed to the advancement of women's rights. Among the recipients of the 'Courageous Women of the World' prize was Rina Gono-i, a former Ground Self-Defense Force member who bravely spoke out about her own sexual assault and advocated for military reform. Next, we turn our attention to the Kashiwazaki-Kariwa nuclear power plant in Niigata Prefecture. Tokyo Electric Power Company has requested the International Atomic Energy Agency to conduct an on-site investigation to assess the improvements made in counterterrorism measures. The findings and recommendations from the IAEA will be crucial for ensuring the safety of the plant. On a lighter note, the warm winter has had an unexpected impact on Mount Rokko in Kobe. Normally, the frozen ice on the pond is harvested and stored for use as a natural cooler during the summer. However, due to the lack of sufficient ice this winter, the ski resort had to transport snow to serve as a substitute. Shifting gears to online trends, a non-profit organization dedicated to suicide prevention has created a platform called 'Kakurega' for people who are struggling with difficult emotions. The platform encourages individuals to take a break and hide from the world if they are unable to cope with their current hardships. 'Kakurega' has gained significant attention, with over 300,000 visits within just three days of its launch. In the aftermath of the Noto Peninsula earthquake, stakeholders in the Wajima lacquerware industry are taking steps towards resuming their operations. With funds raised through crowdfunding, they are preparing a facility in Kanazawa City that will serve as a production and sales base. And finally, the Japan Meteorological Agency's review panel has concluded that this winter was exceptionally warm, with the national average temperature ranking as the second highest on record. The panel attributes this abnormal warmth to global warming and warns that similar warm winters may occur in the future. That's all for today's news. Thank you for listening to Japan Daily News. And now for the weather. Today in Tokyo, the weather will be mostly clear with a high of 8°C and a low of 4°C. There is a chance of patchy rain nearby later in the day. The wind will be gentle, with a maximum speed of 19 km/h. Overall, it will be a cool and partly cloudy day.  Visit JapanDailyNews.com for the news, yen exchange rates, and a daily Japanese proverb.
