Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on May 22nd, 2024. In today's news, the re-trial for Hachiro Hakamada, who was sentenced to death for the murder of a family in Shizuoka Prefecture 58 years ago, has reached its final stage. The prosecution and defense made their closing arguments today, marking the end of all proceedings.

Moving on to our next story, public safety authorities across the country are preparing to designate the Yamaguchi-gumi and Kizuna-kai as specific boryokudan, or designated violent organized crime groups. This decision comes as a response to the increasing number of incidents believed to be related to their ongoing conflict. The authorities are concerned that the intensifying rivalry between the two groups may pose a danger to the public, and stricter measures will be implemented to address this issue.

Next, the Tokyo Metropolitan Government is taking steps to prevent customer harassment, known as 'kasuhara,' by introducing the nation's first ordinance targeting both customers and individuals who use government offices. The proposed ordinance aims to address the issue of harassment in various settings and calls for measures to be implemented across the public and private sectors.

In other news, a fire broke out in Saga Prefecture, causing the car belonging to Nobutaro Wakiyama, the mayor of Genkai Town, to be completely destroyed. Fortunately, there were no injuries reported, and the police are currently investigating the cause of the fire.

In a major case involving money laundering, it has been revealed that a group of individuals established paper companies and engaged in fraudulent activities, laundering funds amounting to approximately 400 million yen each month. The group managed multiple accounts, with at least 60 billion yen being deposited. The police are conducting a thorough investigation into the matter.

Moving on, the former organization employee from Yamanashi Prefecture, who was previously arrested for disposing of a female colleague's body in a riverside area, is expected to be rearrested today on suspicion of murder. It has been revealed that the woman was strangled to death.

Lastly, we turn our attention to the Noto Peninsula earthquake, which occurred over four months ago. The Disaster Response Headquarters Meeting in Ishikawa Prefecture, attended by mayors and other officials from affected municipalities, provided updates on the current situation, future prospects, and challenges faced by the disaster-stricken areas. The participants also highlighted the need for necessary support and assistance in their statements. And now for the weather. Today in Tokyo, the weather will be partly cloudy with a maximum temperature of 23°C and a minimum temperature of 18°C. There is a 100% chance of rain and a UV index of 8. Enjoy your day!
