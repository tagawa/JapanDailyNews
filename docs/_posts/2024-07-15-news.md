Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on July 15th, 2024. In today's news, we have some significant stories from Japan.

First, experts have discovered that the tsunami that occurred in October last year was caused by repeated changes in the underwater terrain due to an underwater volcano near Torishima, part of the Izu Islands.

Moving on to weather news, heavy rainfall is affecting Kyushu, with particularly intense rain in some areas. The unstable atmospheric conditions have led to the formation of a rain band, which may result in heavy rain and the risk of landslides, flooding, and river overflow in northern Kyushu and Yamaguchi Prefecture. The Japan Meteorological Agency is urging residents to be cautious and take necessary precautions.

In transportation news, due to the heavy rain, the Kyushu Shinkansen between Kumamoto and Kagoshima Chuo stations has suspended operations since the first train of the day.

In Kagoshima, the entire Yuda district in Satsumasendai City has been issued an evacuation order due to the risk of landslides. The city issued the order at 4:25 am, calling for everyone to evacuate from the dangerous areas.

Turning to international news, authorities have cracked down on operators of pirate websites that illegally distribute popular Japanese anime and manga. Over the past three years, a total of 22 individuals, including operators based in China and Brazil, have been arrested by local authorities. The estimated damage caused by piracy of Japanese content amounts to 2 trillion yen, and industry organizations are working to strengthen countermeasures.

In Hokkaido, there have been multiple rescue requests from people who became stranded while climbing mountains such as Biei and Tokachi due to heavy snowfall. Police and firefighters are conducting search and rescue operations.

Lastly, a tragic accident occurred in Sanuki City, Kagawa Prefecture, where a couple in their 70s died after their car collided with a guardrail on a prefectural road.

That's all for today's news. Stay tuned for more updates from Japan Daily News. And now for the weather. Today in Tokyo, the weather will be partly cloudy with a high of 29°C and a low of 23°C. There is a chance of light rain showers throughout the day.  Visit JapanDailyNews.com for the news, yen exchange rates, and a daily Japanese proverb.
