### Transcript

Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on September 30th, 2023. In today's news, Tokyo University is hosting an exhibition showcasing the physical characteristics and daily life of people from the Jomon period to the Edo period, based on skeletal remains. Moving on to another story, a 27-year-old mother in Abiko, Chiba Prefecture, has been arrested for the death of her 3-year-old son, who was found wrapped in a futon. The mother has stated that she would wrap her son in a futon almost every day. In other news, the Japanese government is discussing measures to address over-tourism, including a proposal to require tourists to be accompanied by guides when entering certain areas. Additionally, the Japan Meteorological Agency is urging caution as unstable atmospheric conditions are expected in western and northern Japan, with the possibility of thunderstorms, gusts of wind, and heavy rain. Looking ahead, the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism plans to double the transportation volume by ships and trains over the next 10 years, as an alternative to long-haul trucking, in response to concerns about a shortage of truck drivers. Shifting gears, the government is finalizing preparations to request the dissolution of the former Unification Church in court. Finally, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare has decided to conduct an annual survey on the employment status of foreign workers, including wages and working hours, starting from this year. And now for the weather. Today in Tokyo, the weather will be partly cloudy with a high of 27°C and a low of 26°C. There is a chance of patchy rain throughout the day.  And that's all for today's news. Thanks for listening to Japan Daily News.
