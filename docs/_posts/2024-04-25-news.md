Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on April 25th, 2024. In today's news, a large-scale power outage has struck Miyakojima Island in Okinawa. Over 25,000 households have been affected, and there is no estimated time for restoration. Moving on to transportation news, the JR Utsunomiya Line will be suspended between Kuki and Koga stations from the evening of the 28th to the following morning due to bridge construction work. Bus services and alternative transportation will be provided. In another maritime incident, a Chinese ship from the Chinese Coast Guard has entered Japanese waters near the Senkaku Islands. The Japan Coast Guard has issued warnings for the ship to leave immediately. Shifting gears to the healthcare sector, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare's expert panel has recommended industry consolidation to ensure a stable supply of generic drugs. The panel suggests that manufacturers should reorganize and improve production efficiency. In business news, a medical equipment sales company in Tokyo is facing an administrative order for engaging in prohibited bundled sales. The company had been selling its products with the requirement to use their own disinfectant, violating antitrust laws. Finally, it has been 19 years since the derailment accident on the JR Fukuchiyama Line, which claimed the lives of 107 people. Nearly 70% of the employees hired after the accident are still working at JR West Japan, posing a challenge on how to convey the memories and lessons of the accident. And lastly, in a heartwarming story, a special entrance ceremony was held at a primary school in Isa City, Kagoshima. Eight child goats joined the school as first-year students, bringing joy to the children. And now for the weather. Today in Tokyo, the weather will be partly cloudy with a maximum temperature of 23°C and a minimum temperature of 14°C. There is a 100% chance of rain and a UV index of 7. The average temperature will be around 19°C.  Visit JapanDailyNews.com for the news, yen exchange rates, and a daily Japanese proverb.
