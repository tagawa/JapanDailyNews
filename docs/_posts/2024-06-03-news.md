Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on June 3rd, 2024. In today's news, a strong earthquake with a magnitude of 5.9 struck Ishikawa Prefecture, causing strong shaking with an intensity of 5 on the seismic scale. The earthquake was considered an aftershock of the Noto Peninsula earthquake that occurred on New Year's Day. Although the mechanism of both earthquakes was the same, the magnitude of today's earthquake was relatively small, so no tsunami was generated.

In related news, train services have been suspended on the Shinetsu Main Line between Naoetsu Station in Joetsu City and Tsukayama Station in Nagaoka City, as well as on the Hokuhoku Line between Kubiki Station and Sado Station, both in Niigata Prefecture.

Meanwhile, the Noto-Mikawa Interchange to Anamizu Interchange section of the Noto Expressway in Wajima City, Ishikawa Prefecture, has been closed for inspection work since around 7:30 a.m.

Moving on to other news, there have been no abnormal findings at the Kashiwazaki-Kariwa Nuclear Power Plant in Kashiwazaki City, Niigata Prefecture, operated by Tokyo Electric Power Company, and the Shiga Nuclear Power Plant in Shiga Town, Ishikawa Prefecture, operated by Hokuriku Electric Power Company. All reactors at both plants have been shut down for an extended period of time, and there have been no abnormalities reported so far. Radiation levels around the nuclear plants have remained stable according to monitoring posts.

Switching gears, a survey conducted by private organizations has revealed that approximately 30% of childcare facilities are unable to implement the revised standards for the placement of childcare workers for children aged 3 to 5. The exact timing for the implementation remains uncertain.

Lastly, the Japan Meteorological Agency has issued a warning for heavy rain, thunderstorms, and localized gusts of wind, including possible tornadoes, in eastern and northern Japan tonight. Please exercise caution and stay safe. And now for the weather. Today in Tokyo, the weather will be partly cloudy with a maximum temperature of 22°C and a minimum temperature of 18°C. There is a chance of patchy rain nearby in the afternoon.  Visit JapanDailyNews.com for the news, yen exchange rates, and a daily Japanese proverb.
