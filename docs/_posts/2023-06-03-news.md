### Transcript

Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on June 3rd, 2023. The heavy rain and flooding in Japan continue to cause damage and danger, with one person dead and two missing in Aichi and Wakayama prefectures. The Tokyo Bay Ferry service has resumed after being suspended due to strong winds and high waves. The university entrance exams this year will not require masks to be worn during the tests, returning to pre-pandemic conditions. The JR Yamanote Line and Shonan-Shinjuku Line have both resumed operation after being suspended due to fallen trees. However, the JR Yokosuka Line's upbound service between Totsuka and Yokohama stations is still suspended due to soil and sand flowing onto the tracks. The Tokaido Shinkansen service between Tokyo and Nagoya was suspended in the morning due to heavy rain, but limited service has resumed between Nagoya and Shin-Osaka. The danger of landslides and flooding remains high in many areas, and people are advised to stay safe and follow evacuation information from local authorities. And now for the weather. Today in Tokyo, it will be mostly cloudy with heavy rain in the morning and moderate rain in the afternoon. Temperatures will range from 20-24°C (68-76°F) with high humidity and strong winds.  And that's all for today's news. Thanks for listening to Japan Daily News.
