Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on November 4th, 2023. In today's news, researchers at Yokohama City University have started a clinical study to understand the mechanism behind a post-COVID-19 condition known as 'brain fog', which causes memory impairment and other cognitive issues. Meanwhile, a magnitude 5.6 earthquake struck western Nepal, resulting in the death of at least 17 people and injuries to over 30 others. The earthquake, with its epicenter approximately 500 kilometers west of the capital Kathmandu, occurred at a depth of about 18 kilometers. Local authorities are currently conducting rescue operations, and the full extent of the damage is yet to be determined. Moving on, the Tobu Tojo Line in Saitama Prefecture has suspended train services between Kawagoe City and Morinomiyako due to a signal malfunction. In other news, personnel records of military doctors involved in bacteriological warfare units, including the notorious Unit 731, have been discovered in the roster of former Japanese Army officers. These records shed light on the human resources involved in bacteriological research conducted by the Japanese military from pre-war to the early post-war period. The disclosure of these records is considered significant in understanding the overall picture of Japan's bacteriological warfare research during World War II. Shifting our focus, an investigation is underway regarding an accident during a festival in Izu-no-Kuni City, Shizuoka Prefecture, where a festival float overturned, resulting in the death of a 72-year-old man and injuries to 18 others. The police suspect negligence in the performance of duties and are conducting a detailed investigation, including interviewing festival organizers. As we move on, experts are urging caution in crowded areas, particularly in Osaka's Dotonbori district, as the Japan Series between the Hanshin Tigers and the Orix Buffaloes is expected to draw a large crowd. The experts are concerned about the potential for crowd accidents similar to the one that occurred in Seoul, South Korea last year. Lastly, in Naka-gawa City, Fukuoka Prefecture, three children, aged 4 to 9, sustained minor injuries after being attacked by a monkey that appeared in a residential area. The city has been experiencing a series of monkey-related incidents, prompting the police to issue warnings to residents to remain vigilant. And now for the weather. Today in Tokyo, the weather will be clear with a maximum temperature of 24°C and a minimum temperature of 19°C.
