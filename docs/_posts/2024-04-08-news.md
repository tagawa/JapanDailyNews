Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on April 8th, 2024. In weather news, the Japan Meteorological Agency has issued a warning for intense rainfall in the Kanto Region and Izu Islands. Due to the influence of a front and a low-pressure system, heavy rain accompanied by thunderstorms is expected to fall intermittently from tomorrow afternoon, leading to heavy rainfall in some areas. The agency is urging residents to be cautious of landslides, flooding in low-lying areas, and rising river levels.

Renowned architect Kengo Kuma has been appointed as an advisor for the reconstruction plan of Wajima City in Ishikawa Prefecture. Kuma visited the city, which was severely affected by the Noto Peninsula earthquake, and held a meeting with Mayor Shigeru Sakaguchi. He will contribute his expertise to the development of the city's reconstruction plan.

Moving on to other news, four people in their 20s to 50s were bitten by a dog that escaped from a nearby house in Tochigi City. Fortunately, their injuries were minor and the dog has been captured. Police are investigating the circumstances and the dog's living environment.

In Taiwan, the search continues for missing individuals following an earthquake off the eastern coast. So far, 13 deaths have been confirmed, and rescue efforts are ongoing to locate those who remain unaccounted for in areas affected by landslides and rockfalls. On a positive note, some roads in the affected areas have reopened, allowing stranded tourists to resume their travels.

A panel discussion on nuclear disarmament was held, focusing on the movie 'Oppenheimer,' which depicts the struggles of the scientists who developed the atomic bomb and won an Academy Award this year. Experts participating in the discussion expressed the hope that the film would serve as a catalyst for raising awareness about the threat of nuclear weapons.

In Aomori Prefecture, there have been seven incidents of fires spreading from burning branches in fields, resulting in one fatality in Kuroishi City. Authorities are cautioning the public about the increased risk of fires due to dry conditions.

Lastly, in the town of Fukami in Wajima City, Ishikawa Prefecture, residents who had evacuated due to the Noto Peninsula earthquake gathered beneath cherry blossom trees, reaffirming their commitment to return to their hometown. And now for the weather. Today in Tokyo, the weather will be cloudy with a high of 18°C and a low of 15°C. There is a chance of light rain showers throughout the day.
