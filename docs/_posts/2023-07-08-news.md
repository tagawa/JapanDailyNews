### Transcript

Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on July 8th, 2023. In today's news, a heavy rainfall warning has been issued in Shimane Prefecture as a linear rain band continues to bring intense rain to the area. The Japan Meteorological Agency has warned of the increased risk of landslides and floods and urged people to take precautions. Moving on, it has been a year since the shooting incident targeting former Prime Minister Abe. The trial of the accused, Tohru Yamagami, is expected to be postponed until next year as the proceedings are still in the early stages. In other news, a wide area of western to northern Japan is at risk of heavy rain in the coming days due to the influence of a front. Areas that have already experienced heavy rain are particularly vulnerable to disasters such as landslides and river flooding. Shifting our focus, the prosecution is finalizing its plan to present evidence of guilt in the retrial of Iwao Hakamada, who was sentenced to death for the murder of a family of four in Shizuoka Prefecture 57 years ago. Authorities suspect arson as multiple incidents of burned trees and grass have been discovered at the UNESCO World Heritage site, Motsuji Temple, in Hiraizumi-cho, Iwate Prefecture. In a diplomatic agreement, the Japanese and American governments have decided that the flight training of the U.S. military's Osprey transport aircraft will be conducted at lower altitudes, ranging from approximately 60 to 150 meters, starting from the 10th of this month. Concerns have been raised regarding the impact of Twitter's restrictions on the dissemination of disaster information. Many local governments rely on Twitter for sharing emergency information, but recent changes in the platform's usage, such as limitations on browsing and posting, have hindered their efforts. Some municipalities are unable to provide evacuation information during disasters, prompting them to encourage residents to check for updates through alternative channels such as email and official websites. Lastly, a panel of experts advising the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare on COVID-19 measures has warned that there is a possibility of a certain level of infection spread occurring during the summer. The current infection situation shows a gradual increase nationwide, with a particular focus on the expansion of cases in Okinawa Prefecture. Basic measures such as hand hygiene, ventilation, and proper mask usage in appropriate situations are emphasized as crucial in preventing further spread of the virus. And now for the weather. Today in Tokyo, the weather will be cloudy with a maximum temperature of 25 degrees Celsius and a minimum temperature of 24 degrees Celsius. There is a 95% chance of rain throughout the day.  And that's all for today's news. Thanks for listening to Japan Daily News.
