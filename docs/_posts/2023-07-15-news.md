### Transcript

Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on July 15th, 2023. In our first news story, the Akita River in Akita City has exceeded the dangerous flood level at the Kasagake Observatory. The local authorities have issued a warning and are urging residents to pay attention to future updates from the city.

Moving on to our second headline, police officers from Ukraine have visited Fukushima Prefecture to learn identification techniques from the Japanese police. With the ongoing military invasion by Russia, identifying the victims has become a challenge. The Ukrainian officers, who have studied DNA analysis and other techniques, plan to apply their experience to their work back home.

Next, in Osaka, a Brazilian national has been arrested in connection with the murder of his wife and 3-year-old daughter. The incident occurred in their home in Sakai City last August, and the husband had been on the run internationally.

In other news, due to heavy rain, the Akita Shinkansen line has suspended operations between Morioka and Akita stations. Only three trains will be running today, with the first one departing from Akita station at 7:38 AM and the last one departing from Morioka station at 8:15 AM.

Meanwhile, in Akita Prefecture, the Waki Moto area of Oga City has been issued an evacuation order due to the risk of landslides. Approximately 3,312 people from 1,622 households have been instructed to evacuate to the Waki Moto Community Center.

Shifting gears, the Tokyo Metropolitan Government plans to introduce a generated AI called 'ChatGPT' in all departments starting in August. This AI will be utilized for reference in document creation and other tasks.

Heading north, heavy rain is expected in the northeastern region, particularly along the Japan Sea coast. There is a risk of landslides, flooding in low-lying areas, and increased river water levels. Residents are advised to evacuate before the situation worsens.

Lastly, in Oga City, Akita Prefecture, the evacuation information for elderly and disabled individuals has been issued due to the potential for landslides and floods. This Level 3 alert advises elderly and physically challenged individuals to begin their evacuation process.

That wraps up today's news from Japan Daily News. Stay tuned for more updates and stay safe. And now for the weather. Today in Tokyo, the weather will be partly cloudy with a maximum temperature of 26°C and a minimum temperature of 25°C.  And that's all for today's news. Thanks for listening to Japan Daily News.
