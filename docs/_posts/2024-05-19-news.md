Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on May 19th, 2024. In today's news, we have two significant stories from Japan.

First, let's talk about a health condition that is affecting people's ability to enjoy sweets. It's called Inflammatory Bowel Disease or IBD. People who suffer from IBD experience sudden stomach pain and are unable to freely eat snacks like chocolate, potato chips, or cookies. This condition has been causing a lot of distress for those affected. Our reporter, Ayari Suzuki, brings us more information on this.

Moving on to our next story, two police officers in Akita were seriously injured in a bear attack. The incident occurred in a mountainous area of Kakunodate City. The officers were searching for two missing individuals in their 60s when they were attacked by a bear shortly after discovering a man's body. The authorities are now conducting a renewed search. Stay tuned for updates on this developing story.

In other news, a tragic incident took place in Hirakata City, Osaka. A 19-year-old female college student was found stabbed to death in her apartment. A 26-year-old man has been arrested as a suspect in the case. According to the police, the victim and the suspect were in a relationship. Our thoughts go out to the victim's family and friends during this difficult time.

Shifting gears, the Fukki Hikiyama Festival was held in the Fukki district of Takaoka City, Toyama. The festival, which aims to promote recovery from the Noto Peninsula earthquake liquefaction damage, was scaled down this year. Local residents came together to enjoy the magnificent floats and express their hopes for the region's recovery.

In a concerning development, a survey conducted by a research group from Waseda University revealed that half of the healthcare professionals who provided information about the novel coronavirus on television and in newspapers have experienced attacks such as defamation and harassment. Some experts even received death threats. The researchers emphasize the need to protect these professionals from threats and ensure a healthy environment for open discussions.

Next, a fire broke out in the hot spring town of Gero in Gifu Prefecture. The fire originated from a restaurant and spread to nearby buildings. Firefighting efforts are still underway, but fortunately, no injuries have been reported so far.

Lastly, Afghanistan has been hit by severe flooding caused by heavy rainfall. According to reports, at least 50 people have lost their lives, and thousands of homes have been destroyed. Our hearts go out to the people affected by this natural disaster.

That's all for today's news. Thank you for listening to Japan Daily News. Stay informed and have a great day! And now for the weather. The weather in Tokyo today will be partly cloudy with a maximum temperature of 23°C and a minimum temperature of 16°C.
