Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on September 26th, 2024. The Japan Bus Association has announced its ambitious plans to fully implement autonomous driving and cashless payment systems in the bus industry by 2030. This initiative comes as the industry grapples with challenges such as a shortage of drivers, aiming to modernize and enhance operational efficiency in the coming years.

In maritime news, the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force's escort ship 'Sazanami' has made its first passage through the Taiwan Strait, a significant move that underscores Japan's commitment to freedom of navigation in the region. This passage is particularly noteworthy as it occurs amid heightened tensions surrounding maritime activities in the strait, which often draw criticism from China when foreign vessels navigate these waters.

Turning to the judicial system, today marks a pivotal moment for Iwao Hakamada, whose case has been under scrutiny for nearly 60 years. The Shizuoka District Court is set to deliver its verdict on his retrial concerning a gruesome murder case that resulted in a death sentence. Given the historical context, previous retrials in similar cases have led to acquittals, raising hopes for Hakamada's potential exoneration.

In a concerning development, the Noto region in Ishikawa Prefecture has been severely affected by record rainfall, resulting in floods and landslides. As of now, the death toll has risen to 11, with ongoing search efforts for missing residents being conducted by police and firefighters.

On the volcanic front, the newly established Volcanic Research Promotion Headquarters, created by the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, has prioritized detailed investigations into eight volcanoes, including Sakurajima. This initiative aims to enhance disaster preparedness and understanding of volcanic activity in the region.

In legal news, a group of seven individuals, including the celebrity Kenji Haga, have been arrested for allegedly engaging in fraudulent property registrations to evade asset seizure. Authorities are currently withholding further details as investigations continue.

Lastly, the Kanto Transport Bureau has issued a warning to Tokai Kisen regarding a drifting incident involving a jet ferry off the coast of Boso Peninsula earlier this year. The bureau has called for improved safety management protocols and compliance with regulations to prevent future incidents. And now for the weather. Today in Tokyo, expect a warm day with a high of 28 degrees Celsius, some clouds, and a chance of light rain in the evening.
