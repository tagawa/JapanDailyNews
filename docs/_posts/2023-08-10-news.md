Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on August 10th, 2023. In today's news, a member of the Tokyo Agriculture University Boxing Club has been arrested on suspicion of possessing marijuana for the purpose of sale. This is the third arrest related to marijuana possession within the club, and the police are investigating the possibility of marijuana spreading within the club. Moving on to weather news, the impact of Typhoon 6 has resulted in the formation of a continuous band of heavy rain called a 'linear precipitation zone' in Oita, Miyazaki, Ehime, and Kochi prefectures, posing a high risk of disasters. Additionally, Typhoon 7 is expected to approach the Ogasawara Islands while maintaining its strong winds, requiring caution for strong winds and high waves. Please stay tuned for the weather forecast by meteorologist Satoshi Sato. Continuing with local news, the city of Kobayashi in Miyazaki Prefecture has switched the information from 'emergency safety assurance' to 'evacuation for the elderly and others' as the risk of hazards has decreased. In aviation news, numerous flights to and from airports in Kyushu are expected to be canceled due to the impact of Typhoon 6. It is important to note that even after the typhoon passes, there is still a high risk of landslides, flooding in low-lying areas, and river flooding. Finally, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare has created four indicators as a reference for prefectures to issue cautionary alerts to residents during the spread of COVID-19. These indicators include the occupancy rate of secured hospital beds exceeding 50%. As for Typhoon 7, it is expected to approach the Ogasawara Islands on the 12th, bringing strong winds and high waves. There is still some uncertainty regarding its exact path, but it may approach eastern and western Japan with a high intensity next week, potentially causing heavy rain and severe weather. Please stay updated with the latest information and exercise caution.   And that's all for today's news. Thanks for listening to Japan Daily News.
