Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on October 5th, 2023. In today's news, we have two significant stories from Japan. First, in northern Japan, there is a concern for very strong winds similar to a typhoon. Due to the influence of developing low-pressure systems and fronts, extremely strong winds are expected to blow in northern Japan from tonight until tomorrow. The seas will also be rough, and the atmosphere is very unstable. In Hokkaido, heavy rain is falling in some areas, and the Japan Meteorological Agency is warning of strong winds, high waves, landslides, flooding in low-lying areas, and rising river levels.

Moving on to our second story, in the town of Misato in Akita Prefecture, three bears were found inside a workshop that produces tatami mats. The bears had entered the workshop on the morning of the 4th and remained inside for over 20 hours. On the morning of the 5th, it was confirmed that the three bears were inside the workshop by using a trap set up inside.

That's all for today's news. Stay tuned for more updates from Japan Daily News.   And that's all for today's news. Thanks for listening to Japan Daily News.
