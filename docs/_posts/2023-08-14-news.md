### Transcript

Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on August 14th, 2023. In our first news story, the Pacific side of Tohoku has been experiencing unstable atmospheric conditions due to the influence of a front and warm, humid air. In Iwate Prefecture's Iwaizumi Town, a record-breaking rainfall of about 40% of the annual average rainfall occurred in just half a day. The unstable atmospheric conditions are expected to continue until the 15th, and strict vigilance against landslides and other disasters is necessary.

Moving on to our second news story, a strong Typhoon 7 is moving northwest over the sea southwest of Hachijojima in the Izu Islands. There is a possibility that it will make landfall in the Tokai and Kansai regions on the 15th. From the afternoon of the 14th to the afternoon of the 15th, there is a possibility of a 'linear rain band' occurring in the Tokai region, and from the afternoon of the 14th to the night of the 15th in the Kansai region. Please exercise extreme caution against landslides and other disasters. We also have a weather forecaster, Yasuhiro Hiyama, providing an explanation on the future path of the typhoon, as well as the expected rain and wind conditions. Please note that this information was not broadcasted on the data broadcasting service.

Continuing with the weather-related news, our third news story also focuses on Typhoon 7. It highlights the possibility of a 'linear rain band' occurring in the Tokai and Kansai regions, which could lead to strong winds, heavy rain, and high tides. The article provides a breakdown of the timing for when to be alert for these weather conditions on a daily basis.

Shifting gears to transportation news, due to the approaching Typhoon 7, JR Tokai has decided to suspend operations on the Tokaido Shinkansen between Nagoya and Shin-Osaka on the 15th. Additionally, there will be a significant reduction in the number of trains between Tokyo and Nagoya, with all seats, except for the Green Car, being unreserved.

In other news, as more employees gradually return to the office, there is a growing emphasis on creating an environment that enhances the working experience.

Lastly, in response to heavy rainfall, Miyako City in Iwate Prefecture has issued evacuation orders for 201 households and 498 people in five areas, including the Satsumachi, Satsumawano, Hata, Mizusawa, and Koboriuchi districts. The evacuation order is at Level 4, the highest level of danger, requiring everyone to evacuate from hazardous areas. The city has opened an evacuation center at the Koboriuchi Fire Community Center.

As for the weather forecast, Niigata is expected to reach 38 degrees Celsius today, so please take extra precautions against heatstroke. Stay hydrated and stay safe in the extreme heat.   And that's all for today's news. Thanks for listening to Japan Daily News.
