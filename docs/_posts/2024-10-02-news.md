Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on October 2nd, 2024. A very strong Typhoon 18 is making its way north near Taiwan and is expected to approach the Sakishima Islands in Okinawa starting October 3rd. The meteorological agency is urging caution due to high waves that may accompany the typhoon. In a separate incident in Saitama Prefecture, a robbery and assault occurred on October 1st, when a group of four broke into a home and stole cash. Three individuals arrested in connection with the crime reportedly claimed that they felt compelled to participate in the robbery after sending their personal information to a mastermind involved in a so-called 'dark job'. Meanwhile, in Shibuya, Tokyo, a new ordinance has been enacted to prohibit drinking on the streets year-round, effective from the evening of October 1st, in response to persistent issues with public drinking around Shibuya Station. In cybersecurity news, the National Police Agency announced the arrest of a suspected member of the 'LockBit' group, known for developing ransomware that targets companies worldwide, following a joint investigation with European police. Additionally, in response to a recent collision incident at Haneda Airport, construction has begun on new lights on the runway to prevent unauthorized access. Lastly, in Okinawa, a 55-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a car he was driving crashed into a crowd during a local festival on September 29th, injuring four people. And now for the weather. Today in Tokyo, it will be partly cloudy with a high of 29 degrees Celsius and a low of 24 degrees Celsius, and there is no chance of rain.
