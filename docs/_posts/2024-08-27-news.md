Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on August 27th, 2024. In transportation news, the Tōkaidō Shinkansen has resumed operations after being suspended due to heavy rain. JR Tōkai announced that trains between Shin-Osaka and Tokyo are now running again, as well as those between Tokyo and Nagoya. However, passengers should expect delays to continue for some time. Similarly, the Sobu Main Line and Narita Line have also resumed operations after earlier delays affecting the lines between Chiba and Sakura, as well as Chiba and Narita Airport. These services were back on track by 8:17 AM today.

Turning to weather, Typhoon No. 10 is approaching the Amami region in Kagoshima Prefecture, expected to bring strong winds and heavy rainfall as it nears the area. The Japan Meteorological Agency has issued warnings, predicting the formation of a linear precipitation zone in the Tokai region, which raises the risk of disasters. They are urging residents to remain vigilant against strong winds, high waves, and potential landslides.

In education, the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology has announced plans to request a funding increase of over 3% for national universities in the next fiscal year's budget. This comes amid rising living costs and ongoing financial pressures faced by these institutions, though it is worth noting that previous requests for funding increases have not been approved in the past seven years.

On a lighter note, a Nissan Cedric police car, the last of its kind in Yamanashi Prefecture, has retired due to aging. Fans gathered at the police station to bid farewell to the iconic vehicle, which has been a beloved presence in the community.

In aviation, more good news comes from Narita Airport, where the number of international travelers during the recent Obon holiday has rebounded to over 80% of pre-pandemic levels, with more than 880,000 passengers using international flights. This increase is attributed to a rise in foreign visitors, signaling a gradual recovery in international travel.

Lastly, in a notable development for the environment, a sugar manufacturer and Kobe University have embarked on a pioneering research project to produce next-generation aviation fuel, known as SAF, using yeast and byproducts from sugar production. This initiative is believed to be the first of its kind in Japan, highlighting innovative approaches to sustainable fuel production. And now for the weather. Today in Tokyo, it will be warm with a high of 31 degrees Celsius, a low of 27 degrees, and there's a chance of patchy rain throughout the day.
