### Transcript

Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on July 12th, 2023. In today's news, strong winds have caused damage in the border areas of Saitama, Ibaraki, Chiba, and Gunma prefectures. The Japan Meteorological Agency has issued a warning for lightning, gusts of wind, and hail, as the atmospheric conditions are expected to remain highly unstable on the 12th. In Fukuoka, residents of the Tanshomaru-cho district recall the devastating landslide that occurred recently. Moving on to the weather, temperatures are expected to rise across the country, with the Kanto and Tokai regions experiencing another day of extreme heat with temperatures exceeding 35 degrees Celsius. Please continue to take precautions against heatstroke. Additionally, on the 12th, a wide area from western to northern Japan is expected to experience highly unstable atmospheric conditions. In Kyushu's northern region, which recently saw record-breaking heavy rainfall, even a small amount of rain can significantly increase the risk of disasters, so please remain vigilant. In other news, the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department plans to re-arrest three individuals involved in the Akita body abandonment case on charges of neglect resulting in death. The investigation revealed that the victim's condition deteriorated rapidly, and she was left unattended, leading to her death. Shifting gears, researchers from outside institutions will conduct a detailed analysis of autopsy records of residents who passed away at the National Hansen's Disease Sanatorium in Okayama Prefecture. Their goal is to shed light on why autopsies were performed even after the introduction of treatment drugs. Turning to a tragic incident in Saga, search and rescue operations will resume in the morning at the site of a landslide in Karatsu City, where two fatalities have been confirmed. One individual remains unaccounted for. In a study conducted by Kyoto University, it was found that 5-year-old children who experienced the COVID-19 pandemic had an average delay in development of over four months compared to children who did not experience the pandemic. And finally, in Yufu City, Oita Prefecture, the body of a 70-year-old man, who had been missing since the heavy rain on June 30th, was discovered at the site of a landslide that swept away a house. These are the news stories for today. Stay informed and stay safe. And now for the weather. Today in Tokyo, the weather will be partly cloudy with a high of 25°C and a low of 24°C. There is a 16% chance of high temperature and an 82% chance of dry weather.  And that's all for today's news. Thanks for listening to Japan Daily News.
