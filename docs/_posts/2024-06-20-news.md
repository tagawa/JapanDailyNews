Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on June 20th, 2024. In today's news, the Japan Meteorological Agency has issued a heavy rain warning for Kyushu, with the possibility of extremely heavy rain accompanied by thunderstorms from this afternoon until tomorrow. Residents are urged to be cautious of landslides and flooding in low-lying areas.

After a hiatus of approximately 9 months, the Soragumi performances of the Takarazuka Revue will resume today. The performances were suspended following the death of a 25-year-old troupe member, and the revue has been working towards preventing power harassment and apologizing to the bereaved family. It will be interesting to see how these efforts are incorporated into future performances.

Starting today, a new system will address the concerns of victims of voyeurism and child pornography. Prosecutors will be able to delete image data of voyeurism and child pornography, regardless of whether the case is prosecuted or not.

A 38-year-old sergeant from the Kanagawa Prefectural Police has been arrested on suspicion of attempted theft of laundry. The sergeant allegedly tried to steal laundry that was hanging in an apartment in Hadano City. The sergeant denies the allegations.

In an effort to promote the use of the My Number health insurance card, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare plans to double the lump sum payment to medical institutions that increase their usage. The maximum payment will be raised to 400,000 yen.

The Japan Meteorological Agency is considering increasing the number of tsunami gauges as part of its efforts to strengthen the observation network for earthquakes and tsunamis. Chief Cabinet Secretary Takashi Mori stated that they are studying the latest research findings to improve the observation system.

Lastly, the Tokyu Oimachi Line has resumed operations after being suspended due to a personal accident between Oimachi Station and Ookayama Station. And now for the weather. Today in Tokyo, the weather will be mostly sunny with a high of 27°C and a low of 22°C.  Visit JapanDailyNews.com for the news, yen exchange rates, and a daily Japanese proverb.
