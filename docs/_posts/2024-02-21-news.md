Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on February 21st, 2024. In today's news, a scandal involving airport security breaches has come to light. It has been revealed that a subsidiary of Japan Airlines, as well as two other airlines, engaged in unauthorized document viewing during an internal driving test conducted within the restricted area of Haneda Airport. The same misconduct was also found in another subsidiary of All Nippon Airways, prompting both airlines to cancel the test and issue apologies.

Next, in honor of 'Takeshima Day' on February 22nd, the cafeteria at Shimane Prefectural Office served a special dish called 'Takeshima Seafood Curry.' This curry was uniquely prepared to resemble the shape of Takeshima, an island disputed between Japan and South Korea.

Moving on, a meeting was held at the Japan Meteorological Agency to discuss providing information on evacuations and rescue efforts in the event of prolonged tsunamis. Experts and specialists shared their opinions on proposals for predicting the duration of tsunamis and other related matters.

The police have arrested five individuals aged 17 to 21 on charges of assault and confinement, and are investigating the connection to the dispute.

Meanwhile, a traditional event called 'Suribachi Yaito' took place at a temple in Sabae City, Fukui Prefecture on February 20th. During the event, participants had incense burned on their heads while holding an upside-down mortar, symbolizing prayers for good health and academic success.

Lastly, in an effort to prevent fraud targeting the elderly, the city of Chofu in Tokyo has decided to fully subsidize the installation of AI devices that can detect potentially fraudulent phone calls. This initiative aims to protect senior citizens from falling victim to scams by identifying suspicious conversations in real-time.
