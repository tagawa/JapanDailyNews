Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on July 10th, 2024. In a landmark decision, the Japanese High Court has granted a request from an individual diagnosed with gender identity disorder to change their registered gender from male to female without undergoing surgery. This is highly unusual as the law currently requires surgical procedures to resemble the desired gender. Moving on to transportation news, the Tohoku Shinkansen line between Morioka and Shin-Aomori has resumed its service after being temporarily suspended due to delayed inspection work. The delay was caused by an oil leak from a maintenance vehicle. The railway company expects to resume full service by 9 a.m. today.

In weather news, heavy rain is expected in the Tohoku and eastern regions of Japan on the 11th and in western Japan on the 12th. This continuous heavy rain may result in landslides, flooding in low-lying areas, and increased water levels in rivers. Caution is advised.

Turning to crime, the ringleader of a group involved in fraudulent online banking transfers has been arrested. The suspect, a 44-year-old individual, was apprehended for illegally accessing internet banking accounts using other people's IDs and passwords. The joint investigation team estimates that the group has caused damages of at least 120 million yen through unauthorized transfers. Meanwhile, in other crime news, all evacuation orders in Shimane Prefecture have been lifted after heavy rainfall. The orders were issued in Izumo City and Unnan City but have now been rescinded.

Lastly, in a money laundering case, a 35-year-old suspect who was arrested on the 9th is believed to be the mastermind behind a group that used paper companies' accounts to launder funds obtained through fraud. This suspect, among the 15 individuals previously arrested, is considered the top leader. The police continue their investigation to uncover the full extent of the group's activities. And now for the weather. Today in Tokyo, the weather will be partly cloudy with a maximum temperature of 33°C and a minimum temperature of 28°C. There is a 0% chance of rain and the UV index is 9, which is very high.  Visit JapanDailyNews.com for the news, yen exchange rates, and a daily Japanese proverb.
