Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on November 27th, 2023. In the latest news, a victim of the Johnny's sexual harassment scandal, Yasushi Hashida, has announced his intention to accept a compensation offer from 'SMILE-UP,' the agency formerly known as Johnny's Entertainment. This development comes after allegations of sexual misconduct by Johnny Kitagawa, the founder of the agency. Moving on to another story, a suspected case of bird flu has been discovered at a poultry farm in Kasama, Ibaraki. Numerous chickens have been found dead, and preliminary tests indicate a possible infection with the avian influenza virus. If confirmed, this would be the second case of bird flu in the country this season. Now, let's turn our attention to the academic world. The president of Nihon University, Takeo Sakai, and the vice president, Yasuhiro Sawada, have expressed their intention to resign amidst the drug scandal involving the university's American football team. The university's board of directors had recommended their resignation due to their handling of the incident. Shifting gears to politics, it has been revealed that over 260 million yen was spent on internet-related political activities, according to the political funds report released by the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications. The expenditures encompassed various areas such as video production, live streaming, and risk management. In the healthcare sector, a symposium on addressing excessive workloads in the medical profession was held in Tokyo ahead of the implementation of the 'Physician Workstyle Reform' next year. The brother of a doctor who died from overwork emphasized the need for tailored measures based on the actual working conditions. Now, let's move on to a tragic incident in Niigata. An elderly couple in their 80s was found dead near a forest road in Sado, Niigata. The husband was discovered near a overturned light truck, while the wife was found about 800 meters away. Police are investigating the circumstances surrounding their deaths. Lastly, in an effort to promote plastic waste reduction, a parade was held in Tokyo's Suginami ward where participants dressed up as monsters using plastic waste, highlighting the importance of reducing plastic waste in food packaging and other areas. And now for the weather. Today in Tokyo, the weather will be sunny with a maximum temperature of 15°C and a minimum temperature of 10°C.
