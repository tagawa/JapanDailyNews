Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on September 23rd, 2024. In Ishikawa Prefecture, the recent record-breaking rainfall has led to tragic outcomes, with authorities confirming six fatalities in the Wajima area. The heavy downpours have also left two individuals missing and eight others unaccounted for, prompting ongoing search and rescue efforts. The situation remains critical as flooding and landslides continue to pose significant risks across the region, urging residents to stay vigilant and avoid riverbanks and unstable slopes.

In a related story, the weather has caused major disruptions in transportation as well. The Sanyo Shinkansen service has been suspended between Hiroshima and Kokura due to prolonged maintenance work, which began the night before. Initially expected to resume by 8 AM today, it is now anticipated that services will not restart until after 9 AM. Travelers are advised to check the latest updates on the railway's official website.

Moving to Aomori, a tragic car accident occurred in Gonohe Town on the 22nd, where a collision between a passenger car and a van resulted in the deaths of two individuals, both of whom were in the car. Two others sustained injuries in this unfortunate incident.

In a lighter story from Wakayama, a new species of shrimp has been discovered along the coast of Shirahama. This newly identified species, named 'Panda Merita Shrimp', features a distinctive black and white pattern reminiscent of the beloved giant panda, a local icon celebrated in the area.

Meanwhile, in Kumano Town, Hiroshima, the annual Brush Festival has taken place, celebrating the region's status as Japan's leading producer of brushes. This event showcases the craftsmanship and cultural significance of brush-making in the area.

Lastly, in Nagano, a serious incident unfolded during an anime song event in Saku City, where a man was stabbed and seriously injured. The suspect, arrested on charges of attempted murder, reportedly stated that he intended to kill the victim. Police are investigating the circumstances that led to this violent encounter, which may involve some prior conflict between the two individuals. And now for the weather. Today in Tokyo, expect light rain with a high of 24 degrees Celsius and a low of 22 degrees Celsius.  Visit JapanDailyNews.com for the news, yen exchange rates, and a daily Japanese proverb.
