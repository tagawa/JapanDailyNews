Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on August 5th, 2024. In today's news, a series of fires have occurred in Saitama Prefecture, with a warehouse in Kuki City completely burned down. The police are investigating the incidents, suspecting arson. In Tsurugashima City, a traditional rain-calling ceremony called 'Ashi-Ori Amagoi' was held for the first time in 8 years, after being canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Moving on to transportation news, the Keio Line, which had suspended operations due to a personal accident in Fuchu City, has resumed full service. As we enter the summer season, Japan is facing intense heatwaves, especially in western and eastern regions. It is crucial to take precautions against heatstroke. However, the weather is expected to become unstable in northern and eastern Japan, raising concerns about landslides, flooding, and increased river water levels. Tragically, a fatal accident occurred in Gifu City, where a watercraft collided with the riverbank, resulting in the death of a 32-year-old man and severe injuries to another person. In Wakayama Prefecture, a father and his high school-aged child went missing during a diving experience in Kushimoto Town. Sadly, the father's body was found underwater, and he was pronounced dead. Finally, in Tokyo, 63 people ranging from 2 to 94 years old were transported to the hospital with suspected heatstroke. Please stay safe and take care during this hot weather. And now for the weather. Today in Tokyo, the weather will be mostly sunny with a high of 34°C and a low of 28°C. There is a 0% chance of rain and the UV index is 9, so don't forget your sunscreen!
