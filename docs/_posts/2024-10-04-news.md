Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on October 4th, 2024. In Saitama, a 24-year-old suspect wanted in connection with a robbery and assault incident in Tokorozawa has reportedly fled the scene by taxi after the crime. The incident occurred on October 1st when a group of four broke into a residence and stole cash and other valuables. Following the robbery, the suspect is believed to have moved to Tokyo, prompting an ongoing investigation by the police.

Turning to weather news, Okinawa is currently facing severe weather conditions as the region experiences record rainfall. The Japan Meteorological Agency has issued a warning for unprecedented short-duration heavy rainfall, with reports indicating that approximately 100 millimeters of rain fell in just one hour. This situation poses a significant risk of disasters, and residents are urged to ensure their safety.

In a similar vein, the area around Yonaguni in Okinawa has also recorded intense rainfall, with the Meteorological Agency confirming the same alarming figures. Residents are being cautioned about the potential for disaster as conditions remain unstable across the region.

Meanwhile, in Shizuoka, a series of incidents attributed to strong gusts of wind were reported in Hamamatsu. On the evening of October 3rd, there were multiple reports of broken windows and roofs being blown off, resulting in minor injuries to one child. The Meteorological Agency is investigating the possibility of tornadoes and other severe wind phenomena in the area.
