Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on May 24th, 2024. In today's news, it has been 27 years since the tragic murder of Atsushi Doshi, a 6th-grade student in Kobe. At the time, he was killed by a 14-year-old boy in a series of child killings. Atsushi's father has recently shared a heartfelt message, stating that his love for his child has remained unchanged over the years and emphasizing the importance of supporting crime victims.

In other news, the 'Soaring Female Researcher Award' ceremony was held yesterday in Tokyo. The award recognizes young female researchers who have made outstanding contributions to their fields. This event comes as the percentage of women in research in Japan remains lower compared to other countries.

Moving on, the US military is set to conduct a large-scale exercise in Japan for the first time in June. This exercise, held every two years in the Pacific region, aims to strengthen Japan's readiness in the event of a crisis in the surrounding areas.

Tragedy struck in Shinagawa, Tokyo, where a fire broke out in a residential area, claiming the lives of a mother and her three children aged 2 to 6. The police have discovered that all four victims had knife wounds. An investigation is underway, and authorities plan to interview the father, who is currently recovering in the hospital, to gather more information.

As bear encounters increase, a panel of experts in Japan has proposed a policy allowing the use of firearms in urban areas under exceptional circumstances. This measure aims to address the growing number of bear-related incidents, even in residential areas, where the use of firearms is currently prohibited unless authorized by the police.

In other news, the Consumer Affairs Agency has analyzed reports of health issues related to functional food products. Following the recent case involving Kobayashi Pharmaceutical's red yeast rice supplement, it has been found that there are 21 other cases where the causal relationship between product consumption and health problems could not be denied.

Lastly, a 61-year-old company president has been arrested in Aichi Prefecture for allegedly lending a shotgun to a 12-year-old boy on a boat off the coast of Tokoname City earlier this year. The arrest was made on suspicion of aiding a violation of the Firearms and Swords Control Law. And now for the weather. The weather in Tokyo today is mostly sunny with a high of 27°C and a low of 19°C.  Visit JapanDailyNews.com for the news, yen exchange rates, and a daily Japanese proverb.
