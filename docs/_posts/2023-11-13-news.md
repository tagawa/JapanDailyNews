Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on November 13th, 2023. In our first news story, there is a trap lurking behind the temptation of becoming stronger easily. Many gamers find themselves unable to devote enough time to leveling up their favorite characters or obtaining rare items. This creates an opportunity for scammers who offer to sell accounts with powerful characters and desired items. Before falling into this easy path to power, it's important to pause and consider the risks.

Moving on to our second headline, a 47-year-old father has been arrested in Yokohama for allegedly assaulting his 2-year-old daughter. The incident occurred in their home back in January, and the father denies the accusations, claiming it was just rough play.

Now, let's turn to politics. Prime Minister Kishida is considering submitting a bill to amend the law in order to prevent 'caregiver resignation' due to caregiving or nursing responsibilities. He believes it is necessary to strengthen measures against dementia and aims to submit the proposed legislation to the next regular session of the Diet.

As the weather takes a sudden turn, residents in Nagano are rushing to get their winter tires changed. After experiencing unseasonably warm temperatures earlier in the week, the sudden drop in temperature has led to a surge in requests for tire replacements at automotive supply stores in Nagano City.

In Osaka, a police officer fired his gun at a man wielding a knife in a residential building. The officer had responded to a report of shouting and upon encountering the man with a knife, issued a warning before firing his weapon. A woman in her 70s was found injured in the apartment, and the police are investigating the incident.

Moving on to weather updates, the influence of cold air in the upper atmosphere has resulted in highly unstable atmospheric conditions in Hokuriku and western Japan. Various regions are experiencing their first snowfall and initial accumulations of snow. Please exercise caution and stay updated on local conditions.

Lastly, the Meteorological Agency has issued warnings for unstable atmospheric conditions in Hokuriku and western Japan. Residents are urged to be cautious of landslides, flooding in low-lying areas, increased river water levels, as well as lightning, tornadoes, and hailstorms.

That wraps up today's news from Japan Daily News. Thank you for tuning in! And now for the weather. Today in Tokyo, the weather will be mostly overcast with a chance of light rain and temperatures ranging from 9 to 15 degrees Celsius.
