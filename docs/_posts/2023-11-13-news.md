Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on November 13th, 2023. In today's news, a YouTuber has been arrested on suspicion of defamation after posting a video insulting an 18-year-old woman. The YouTuber allegedly made false accusations, such as unfairly reselling tickets, in the video. Moving on, a recent survey conducted by NHK revealed that the construction costs for the upcoming Osaka-Kansai Expo are expected to exceed 235 billion yen due to rising material prices. The survey found that 77% of the respondents were not satisfied with the increased burden on the public. In other news, the Takarazuka Revue, a renowned Japanese all-female musical theater troupe, will hold a press conference tomorrow to disclose the findings of an external investigation into the death of a 25-year-old troupe member. The family of the deceased has demanded an apology and compensation, citing long working hours as a contributing factor. Meanwhile, the city of Imabari in Ehime Prefecture is experiencing a surge in the production of zodiac animal figurines, with next year's animal, the dragon, being particularly popular. Additionally, a unique collaboration between virtual idol Hatsune Miku and Kabuki actor Shido Nakamura will be showcased in a performance called 'Super Kabuki' at the Kabuki-za theater in Tokyo. Lastly, experts at a government meeting discussing the reassessment of potential damage from the Nankai Trough earthquake emphasized the importance of raising public awareness and encouraging proactive actions by residents to minimize the impact of the disaster. Finally, in Akita Prefecture's Yokote City, the production of 'Iburigakko,' a local specialty pickled vegetable made by smoking radishes, is currently at its peak. And now for the weather. Today in Tokyo, the weather will be clear with a high of 16°C and a low of 10°C.  Visit JapanDailyNews.com for the news, yen exchange rates, and a daily Japanese proverb.
