### Transcript

Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on October 1st, 2023. Today, we have two significant news stories from Japan.

First, a new tax deduction system called the 'Invoice System' begins today. The purpose of this system is to accurately grasp the amount of consumption tax paid. Small-scale businesses that register for the system will have the obligation to pay taxes. To alleviate the burden, the government has introduced transitional measures and will hold explanatory meetings for businesses to enhance their understanding of the system.

Moving on to our second news story, we have a weather alert for Western and Northern Japan. Due to the influence of moist air flowing towards a front and cold air in the upper atmosphere, the atmospheric conditions in these regions are expected to become highly unstable today. The Japan Meteorological Agency is urging people to be cautious of sudden and intense thunderstorms, as well as severe gusts of wind, including tornadoes.

That's all for today's news. Stay tuned for more updates from Japan Daily News. And now for the weather. Today in Tokyo, there will be patchy rain possible with a high temperature of 27°C and a low temperature of 26°C.  And that's all for today's news. Thanks for listening to Japan Daily News.
