Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on July 30th, 2023. In today's news, a powerful typhoon, Typhoon No. 6, is expected to approach Okinawa and the Amami Islands from the 31st to the 1st of next month. The typhoon is currently moving north-northwest over the sea east of the Philippines and is forecasted to come close to Okinawa and Amami with strong force. On the 31st, violent winds and extremely rough seas are expected, so please exercise extreme caution against strong winds and high waves.

The Expo organizing committee aims to ensure stable operation by selling advance tickets to the business community, but it remains to be seen how companies will respond.

In a somber anniversary, the unsolved case of the Hachioji Supermarket triple murder remains unresolved after 28 years.
