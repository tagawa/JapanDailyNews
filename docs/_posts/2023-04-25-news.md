### Transcript

Welcome to Japan Daily News on April 25, 2023. Today, we have several news stories from Japan and around the world.

First, it has been 18 years since the derailment accident on the JR Fukuchiyama Line that claimed the lives of 107 people. The families of the victims and the company are still discussing the preservation of the accident vehicle, and how to convey the memory and lessons of the accident remains a challenge.

Next, a transport plane dispatched by the Self-Defense Forces to evacuate Japanese residents from Sudan amid worsening conditions has successfully evacuated 45 people to Djibouti. There are still a few Japanese citizens remaining in Sudan who wish to evacuate, and the government is committed to evacuating them as soon as possible.

Moving on, the Tokyo Metropolitan Government is planning to issue an improvement order to a psychiatric hospital in Hachioji City, where a nurse physically abused an inpatient. The government has determined that the hospital's management system was insufficient and failed to detect the abuse early enough.

In Indonesia, a magnitude 7.1 earthquake struck off the west coast of Sumatra, and there is concern about the possibility of a tsunami. NOAA and other organizations are investigating the potential for a tsunami.

The National Police Agency and the Financial Services Agency have issued a warning about a surge in phishing scams that impersonate "online banks" and trick people into revealing their IDs and passwords, resulting in the theft of deposits and other assets.

In addition, more than 3,300 consultations were received last year about "mononashi multi-level marketing," which promises profits by introducing investment opportunities in cryptocurrency and other assets. Nearly half of the inquiries came from people in their teens and twenties, and some cases involved inducing people to invest to the point of incurring debt.

Finally, in response to the record number of children and students who died by suicide last year, the government is planning to establish a new meeting to strengthen measures by the relevant ministries and agencies, including the Child and Family Agency.

And that's all for today's news. Thanks for listening to Japan Daily News.
