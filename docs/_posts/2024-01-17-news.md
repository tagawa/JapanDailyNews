Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on January 17th, 2024. Today marks the 29th anniversary of the Great Hanshin-Awaji Earthquake, which claimed the lives of 6,434 people. In the areas heavily affected by the earthquake, a moment of silence was observed at 5:46 a.m., the time when the earthquake struck. This day serves as a time for reflection on the experiences and lessons learned from the disaster. Additionally, the Noto Peninsula Earthquake, which occurred in the evening, will also be commemorated with a moment of silence. Moving on to other news, approximately 7,800 households in Ishikawa Prefecture are currently experiencing power outages due to the impact of the recent earthquake. The situation is being updated continuously. In the aftermath of the Great Hanshin-Awaji Earthquake, efforts are being made to apply the lessons learned from the disaster. Meanwhile, transportation has been affected by the Noto Peninsula Earthquake. As of 5 a.m. today, there have been disruptions to railways, aviation, and roads. In the affected areas, the cold weather continues to pose challenges, with the risk of hypothermia. Residents are advised to take precautions such as keeping warm with blankets and regular exercise to maintain body temperature. In other news, two individuals claiming to be YouTubers have been arrested for attempted extortion. They posted a video of themselves performing a so-called 'citizen's arrest' on a person suspected of voyeurism and attempted to extort money from them. The police suspect that they may have been involved in similar activities in the past and are currently investigating. The individuals have denied the allegations. In response to the spread of false information on social media related to the Noto Peninsula Earthquake, the government has established a team of experts to develop comprehensive measures to prevent similar incidents in the future. And now for the weather. Today in Tokyo, the weather will be sunny with a maximum temperature of 10°C and a minimum temperature of 3°C.
