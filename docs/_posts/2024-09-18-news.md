Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on September 18th, 2024. This morning, North Korea reportedly launched two projectiles that are believed to be ballistic missiles. Both missiles are thought to have fallen outside Japan's Exclusive Economic Zone, and the Ministry of Defense is maintaining vigilance and monitoring the situation closely.

In weather news, Typhoon 14 is making its way toward Okinawa, with expectations that it will come closest to the region this evening. The Japan Meteorological Agency has issued warnings for high waves and strong winds, urging residents of Okinawa and the Amami region of Kagoshima to take precautions against potential landslides and other hazards associated with the storm.

Moving to local news, a tragic incident occurred in Matsudo, Chiba, where a first-grade boy was struck and killed by a car while crossing a pedestrian crossing on his way home from school. Authorities are investigating the circumstances surrounding the accident.

In a separate incident in Sendai, a 40-year-old woman was found bleeding in an apartment, leading to the arrest of her 19-year-old son on suspicion of attempted murder. The police are continuing their investigation into the details of this case.

On the infrastructure front, a police car in Kuki, Saitama, was involved in an accident early this morning when it was struck by a large truck while parked on the expressway, leading to a fire. Fortunately, there were no injuries reported, but this incident has caused some traffic disruptions in the area.

Lastly, the results of the 2024 Prefectural Land Price Survey were released today, revealing the prices of land across more than 21,400 locations nationwide. NHK has created a map to visualize these prices, highlighting trends in urban areas and popular tourist destinations, giving residents insight into the real estate market in their neighborhoods. And now for the weather. Today in Tokyo, the weather will be sunny with a high of 33 degrees Celsius and a low of 28 degrees Celsius.
