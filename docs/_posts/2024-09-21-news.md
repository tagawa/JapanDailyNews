Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on September 21st, 2024. Today, Prime Minister Kishida announced a significant expansion of support for atomic bomb survivors, specifically targeting those who were outside the designated areas during the bombing in Nagasaki but are still recognized as survivors. This new policy aims to broaden the scope of medical expense assistance for these individuals, ensuring they receive the necessary support they deserve.

In weather-related news, Yamagata Prefecture has lifted evacuation orders for 29 households in the Karikawa area of Shonai Town after heavy rains prompted the initial alerts. The evacuation order was rescinded this morning, allowing residents to return home safely.

However, the situation remains critical in other parts of Japan. In Ishikawa Prefecture, the city of Wajima has issued evacuation orders for 12 districts, affecting 8,867 households and over 18,000 residents, due to an increased risk of landslides from ongoing heavy rainfall. This evacuation notice is classified as level 4 on the five-tier warning system, urging all residents in dangerous areas to evacuate immediately.

Similarly, in Yamagata's Higashine City, evacuation orders have been issued for several districts due to heightened landslide risks. The city has opened evacuation centers at Takasaki and Togo community centers to assist residents in need.

In transportation news, the JR Chuo Line has suspended operations between Tokyo and Takao due to a serious incident involving a person on the tracks at Kokuritsu Station this morning. However, local trains continue to operate as scheduled.

Additionally, the Yamagata Shinkansen service between Yamagata and Shinjo has been completely halted for the day due to the impact of the heavy rains, causing disruptions for many travelers.

Lastly, the forest fire in Yamaguchi City, which ignited on September 18th, has seen a decrease in intensity thanks to overnight firefighting efforts. Despite this progress, the fire has not yet been fully extinguished, and evacuation orders remain in place for 33 nearby households. And now for the weather. Today in Tokyo, it will be mostly sunny with a high of 32 degrees Celsius and a low of 25 degrees, and no chance of rain.
