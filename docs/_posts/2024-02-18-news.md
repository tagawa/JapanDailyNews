Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on February 18th, 2024. In today's news, an ancient Japanese 'reading stand' has been discovered in Portugal. The stand, believed to be made around 400 years ago, is one of the Nanban lacquerwares used for reading the Bible. It has attracted attention as a valuable historical artifact, as there are traces of decorations like crosses being removed, reflecting the fear of Christian persecution at that time.

Moving on to another story, it has been revealed that Yamagata Saisei Hospital in Yamagata City underwent an inspection by the local health department last year. The hospital was found to have non-medical staff performing skin sutures during surgeries. This raises concerns about the safety and quality of medical practices at the hospital.

In a tragic turn of events, a police inspector from the China Shikoku Regional Police Academy, who was arrested and charged with sexually assaulting a woman he met on a dating app, was found unconscious in a detention facility in Hiroshima Prefecture. He was later pronounced dead at the hospital. It is believed that he attempted suicide. This incident highlights the importance of addressing issues of sexual assault and mental health within law enforcement institutions.

As we move on to weather news, temperatures across the country are expected to rise significantly today due to warm air currents. Spring-like warmth is anticipated. However, caution is advised in areas with heavy snowfall, as there is a risk of avalanches and landslides due to snow melting.

Shifting gears to healthcare, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare in Japan is pushing for the establishment of new wards that support early rehabilitation to facilitate the discharge of elderly patients. This initiative aims to address the issue of prolonged hospital stays and declining physical functions among elderly individuals.

In other news, water supply support is scheduled to be provided in various areas of Ishikawa Prefecture, including Wajima and Suzu, on February 18th.

Lastly, there has been an increase in the spread of fake images of Prime Minister Kishida on social media platforms. These manipulated images, created using AI technology and edited to portray a different context, are raising concerns about the rise of political fakes. Experts are urging the public to be cautious and discerning when consuming political content online. And now for the weather. Today in Tokyo, the weather will be cloudy with a high of 14°C and a low of 11°C. There is a 100% chance of rain throughout the day.
