The town of Nagaminato in Chiba Prefecture has issued evacuation orders to all 3,187 households and 7,292 residents due to the increased risk of landslides.

Similarly, the entire city of Isumi in Chiba Prefecture, with its 16,932 households and 35,471 residents, has been advised to evacuate due to the heightened risk of landslides. The Izu Islands in southern Tokyo are experiencing a continuous heavy rainfall due to a linear rain band, which has led to the issuance of a significant heavy rain warning by the Japan Meteorological Agency. The agency has urged residents to be cautious of potential landslides and floods.
