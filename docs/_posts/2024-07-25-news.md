Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on July 25th, 2024. In today's news, we have several significant stories from Japan.

First, Yamagata and Akita prefectures are facing the threat of disaster due to record-breaking heavy rain. According to the Japan Meteorological Agency, intense rainfall of approximately 100 millimeters was observed in the southern part of Sakata City, Yamagata Prefecture, between 9 a.m. and 10 a.m. on the 24th. Additionally, around 110 millimeters of heavy rain was recorded near Yuya Town in Yamagata Prefecture and approximately 100 millimeters near the northern part of Sakata City during the same hour. In response to the imminent danger of a disaster, the Japan Meteorological Agency has issued a 'record-breaking heavy rain warning' and is urging people to ensure their safety.

Moving on to Akita Prefecture, the city of Yurihonjo has experienced flooding due to the record-breaking heavy rain caused by the seasonal rain front. The Ishizawa River, which flows through Yurihonjo City, has overflowed, leading to concerns about flooding and landslides. This heavy rain is also affecting Yamagata and Niigata prefectures, with intensified rainfall. Extreme caution is advised to prevent further damage.

In other news, a jet ship that became inoperable off the coast of the Boso Peninsula in Chiba Prefecture has finally arrived at Izu Oshima Port after drifting for almost a day. The ship, which departed from Tokyo, lost its ability to navigate on the 24th and arrived at the port on the morning of the 25th. Passengers disembarked and were temporarily transferred to accommodation facilities by bus. The operating company is making arrangements for temporary flights and planning the next steps.

As for the weather, Western and Eastern Japan will experience rising temperatures today, with temperatures expected to reach a dangerous 38 degrees Celsius in Kyushu. Due to the increasing number of people being transported with symptoms of heatstroke, it is advised to avoid going out and to take thorough measures to prevent heatstroke.

Lastly, the Kanto-Koshinetsu region is expected to face extremely unstable atmospheric conditions today. Warm and humid air will cause sudden heavy rain, lightning, and strong gusts, including tornadoes. Extra caution is necessary to ensure safety.
