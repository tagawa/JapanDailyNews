Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on September 15th, 2024. In our top story, evacuation orders for over 5,000 households in Setouchi Town, Kagoshima Prefecture, have been lifted as of 6:30 AM today. This follows the impact of Typhoon 13, which has now moved away from the area. The local authorities confirmed that all evacuation orders across the prefecture have been rescinded, allowing residents to return home safely.

However, the effects of Typhoon 13 were felt strongly in the Amami region, where maximum wind gusts exceeded 30 meters per second on the night of the 14th. Although the typhoon is gradually moving away, the Japan Meteorological Agency continues to advise residents in Amami to remain vigilant against potential landslides and high waves.

Meanwhile, the weather remains unstable across northern Japan, particularly in Hokkaido and Tohoku, due to warm and humid air flowing into the region. Heavy rain clouds are developing, prompting warnings for flooding in low-lying areas and the possibility of landslides. The Meteorological Agency urges residents in these regions to exercise caution.

In a tragic incident, a special nursing home transport vehicle collided with a signpost in Takahashi City, Okayama Prefecture, on the afternoon of the 14th. This accident resulted in the deaths of two elderly women who were passengers in the vehicle, while two others sustained minor injuries. Emergency services responded promptly to the scene.

On a different note, a bus connecting to New Chitose Airport caught fire on the Dōō Expressway in Eniwa City, Hokkaido, on the evening of the 14th. Fortunately, all 13 individuals on board, including the driver, escaped without injury, and the cause of the fire is currently under investigation.

Lastly, a significant report has emerged regarding a historical incident referred to as the 'fourth exposure' related to U.S. nuclear tests in the Pacific. A military doctor's report has revealed that some crew members of a Japan Coast Guard vessel, which encountered radiation during a 1958 hydrogen bomb test, experienced severe health issues, including a marked decrease in white blood cell counts. This raises important questions about the long-term health effects of exposure to nuclear testing. And now for the weather. Today in Tokyo, it will be sunny with a high of 33 degrees Celsius and a low of 28 degrees, and the moon is in its waxing gibbous phase.
