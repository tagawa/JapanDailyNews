Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on September 20th, 2024. In today's news, we begin with the severe weather affecting transportation in Japan. The Yamagata Shinkansen has suspended operations between Murayama and Shinjo due to heavy rain, and there is currently no estimate for when service will resume. Similarly, the Akita Shinkansen is also impacted, with trains halted on the route from Tokyo to Akita and from Akita to Morioka. The disruptions are a result of the ongoing heavy rainfall in the region.

Adding to the concern, the Ohso River in Daisen City, Akita Prefecture, has reached a flood danger level as of early this morning. Local authorities have issued a flood warning, urging residents to be vigilant and heed evacuation information from the city.

In addition to the flooding, the Japan Meteorological Agency has reported the formation of a linear rain band along the Akita coastline, which is causing exceptionally heavy rainfall in the area. They have issued warnings for potential disaster risks, advising that the situation could worsen throughout the day, with similar conditions expected in Yamagata Prefecture.

Shifting to a more tragic story, a 24-year-old father in Gunma Prefecture has been arrested for the alleged murder of his infant daughter. Reports indicate that he informed local officials that he could not care for her due to financial difficulties and had entrusted her to an acquaintance. This heartbreaking incident has raised serious concerns within the community.

In Shizuoka, a landslide has trapped approximately 147 individuals, including hikers and construction workers, who are unable to descend from the mountains. They spent the night in mountain lodges, and rescue operations using helicopters began this morning to assist those wishing to evacuate.

Finally, on a concerning note regarding foreign workers in Japan, a record high of over 9,700 foreign technical interns reportedly went missing from their workplaces last year. This alarming statistic highlights issues within the intern system, where changing workplaces is generally not allowed. The government is now looking into measures to address this growing problem. And now for the weather. Today in Tokyo, it will be sunny with a high of 33 degrees Celsius and a low of 28 degrees Celsius, and the moon is in a waning gibbous phase.
