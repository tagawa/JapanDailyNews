Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on February 1st, 2024. In the aftermath of the Noto Peninsula earthquake, which occurred a month ago, volunteers continue to provide assistance to the affected areas. Meanwhile, in Niigata City, there have been delays in issuing disaster certificates, with only 8% of the applications processed as of today. The city explained that the change from mail to in-person issuance and the transition to a tablet-based system for inputting survey results contributed to the delay.

Turning to postal services, the Suzu Ekimae Post Office in Suzu City, Ishikawa Prefecture, and the Matsunami Post Office in Noto Town will resume all counter services, including Yucho Bank and Kampo Life Insurance, starting from February 2nd.

In political news, a citizen group has submitted a complaint to the Tokyo District Public Prosecutors Office, accusing 10 members, including senior officials, of the Abe faction within the Liberal Democratic Party, of tax evasion related to kickbacks received from political funding parties.

Moving on to a crime report, a 55-year-old executive of a designated organized crime group, who had been wanted nationwide for attempted murder in connection with a shooting incident in Miyata Village, Nagano Prefecture, three years ago, was arrested in Sendai City. The arrest took place in a residential complex where the suspect fired a flash grenade before being apprehended by investigators.

In sports news, soccer player Junya Ito has decided to withdraw from the Japanese national team participating in the Asian Cup being held in Qatar. The Japan Football Association has emphasized the need for cautious handling of the situation, taking into consideration the player's physical and mental condition.

Finally, in transportation news, the closure of the downhill lane of the Noto Satoyama Kaido road, which has been in effect since the Noto Peninsula earthquake, is expected to be gradually lifted by mid-March, allowing traffic to flow towards Wajima. And now for the weather. Today in Tokyo, the weather will be partly cloudy with a high of 15°C and a low of 6°C. There is a 30% chance of overcast and a 0% chance of rain. The UV index is 3, indicating moderate sun exposure. Overall, it will be a pleasant day with a gentle breeze.
