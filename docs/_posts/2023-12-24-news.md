Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on December 24th, 2023. In a recent incident in Nara, a landslide occurred on a national highway in the village of Shimokitayama, trapping a car and its male driver. Fortunately, the man was rescued and is conscious. Authorities are currently checking if any other vehicles were involved in the incident. Meanwhile, a survey conducted by NHK reveals that nearly 30% of public high schools in Japan have introduced 'genderless' uniforms, allowing students to choose their attire regardless of their gender. Experts emphasize the importance of flexible measures to support students who may refuse to attend school due to dress codes. In other news, the Ministry of Justice has announced that starting next month, they will revise the operation of the information provision system for the medical observation system. This system aims to assist perpetrators of crimes who have been acquitted or not prosecuted due to mental disorders and are undergoing treatment before reintegrating into society. The revision will improve the support and information given to victims. Heavy snowfall has also caused significant disruptions in Ishikawa, particularly in the mountainous areas of Wajima, where approximately 120 households are currently isolated. The region has experienced snowfall far exceeding the average for this time of year, leading to numerous car accidents and accidents during snow removal operations. On a different note, today marks the 90th birthday of the former Emperor, who celebrated the occasion with a congratulatory event at his residence. Additionally, a memorial gathering was held in Tokyo to honor Masashi Sakurai, who was posthumously acquitted in the so-called 'Nunokawa Incident' that occurred 56 years ago in Ibaraki Prefecture. Attendees, including those who have been exonerated in previous retrials, advocated for legislative reforms related to retrials, carrying on Sakurai's wishes. Lastly, a tragic incident took place in Hokkaido, where a 2-year-old child was fatally struck by their father's moving car on a municipal road in Takikawa City. Police are investigating the possibility that the child's visibility was hindered by snow piled along the roadside, causing a delay in noticing the approaching vehicle. And now for the weather. Today in Tokyo, the weather will be partly cloudy with a high of 9°C and a low of 5°C.  Visit JapanDailyNews.com for the news, yen exchange rates, and a daily Japanese proverb.
