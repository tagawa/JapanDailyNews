Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on October 5th, 2024. Today marks Prime Minister Ishiba's first visit to the Noto region since taking office, as he aims to strengthen disaster response measures in the wake of recent earthquakes and heavy rains that have caused significant damage. During his visit, he is expected to emphasize the government's commitment to recovery and reconstruction efforts, while also discussing the establishment of a disaster management agency to enhance future preparedness.

In related news, the impact of the record rainfall in Noto continues to be felt two weeks after the disaster. Search efforts are ongoing for a 31-year-old woman who remains missing, and over 1,600 households are currently without water, raising concerns about the prolonged effects on residents' daily lives.

Turning to a different topic, a former researcher from the electronics giant TDK has been charged with violating the Unfair Competition Prevention Act for allegedly taking proprietary technology information before leaving the company. Authorities believe he intended to use this information in his job search.

In Chiba, a 60-year-old man has fallen victim to an investment scam involving multiple individuals posing as foreigners, resulting in a loss of approximately 129 million yen. The police are investigating this fraud case as they seek to uncover more details about the perpetrators.

On a more somber note, today marks the 60th birthday of Megumi Yokota, who was abducted by North Korea when she was just a junior high school student. Her mother, Sakie Yokota, attended a gathering in Tokyo where she expressed her deep anguish over the years that have passed and called for the immediate rescue of all abductees.

Lastly, in Nagano, a tragic accident occurred when two trucks collided head-on in a tunnel, resulting in the deaths of two individuals. Authorities are investigating the circumstances surrounding the crash, particularly whether one of the trucks crossed the center line. And now for the weather. Today in Tokyo, expect light rain with temperatures around 22 degrees Celsius and a chance of rain throughout the day.
