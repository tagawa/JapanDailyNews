Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on January 25th, 2024. In today's news, we have two significant stories from Japan. First, the number of bankruptcies among home care providers reached a record high last year, with a total of 67 cases. This increase can be attributed to severe shortages of caregivers and rising fuel costs. Experts analyze the situation, stating that intense competition for talent from other industries and the difficulty of resolving the labor shortage will continue. Moving on to our second story, heavy snowfall is affecting the Japan Sea region, particularly in Hokkaido and Tohoku. The cold air and winter pressure system have caused continuous snowfall, prompting the Meteorological Agency to issue warnings about the impact on transportation. Drivers are advised to exercise caution. Now let's delve into the details of these stories.

The first news story highlights the concerning rise in bankruptcies among home care providers. Last year, a total of 67 cases were reported, marking the highest number on record.
