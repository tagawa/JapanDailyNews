### Transcript

Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on June 7th, 2023. China and Russia's joint military exercise over the East China Sea raises concerns for Japan's defense ministry. Former Japanese politician, Gashi, arrested for repeated threats against celebrities on a video-sharing site. The cause of the train delays on the Nippori-Toneri Liner in Tokyo was due to a bolt being left loose. The Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare's expert panel suggests setting certain requirements for generic drugs to ensure stable supply. A woman was found murdered in Fukuoka, with her hands and feet tied. Train services on the Odakyu Line between Sagami-Ōno and Ebina resumed after a car accident at a level crossing. However, train services were suspended again due to another accident at the same location.  And now for the weather. Today in Tokyo, it will be mostly cloudy with moderate rain throughout the day and temperatures ranging from 19 to 23 degrees Celsius.  And that's all for today's news. Thanks for listening to Japan Daily News.
