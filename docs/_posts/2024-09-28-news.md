Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on September 28th, 2024. In today's news, we start with severe weather warnings for the Izu Islands. The Japan Meteorological Agency has issued alerts for extremely heavy rain expected to continue through tomorrow. Residents are being urged to take precautions against flooding and landslides as a low-pressure system moves in, causing intermittent heavy rainfall across the region.

Moving to Ishikawa Prefecture, it has been one week since the area experienced record-breaking rainfall. Experts are now cautioning that sediment washed down from the mountains is accumulating in rivers, heightening the risk of flooding. Additionally, the region is still grappling with the aftermath of a significant earthquake earlier this year, which has made the area more susceptible to landslides. The dual disasters have raised concerns about how to effectively support those facing these compounded challenges.

In Tokyo's Hino City, following a tragic incident where a man was killed by a falling branch from a ginkgo tree, officials have decided to remove or prune dangerous trees throughout the city starting next month. This decision comes as a response to the heightened awareness of tree safety in public spaces.

In Hiroshima, ongoing emergency repairs are being made after a road collapsed during underground excavation work on the 26th. Initially, the city anticipated that these repairs would be completed by midday today, but delays have pushed the completion time to later this evening.

Lastly, a recent court ruling in Yamaguchi Prefecture has found that a healthcare provider unlawfully suspended home care services when a family member returned home during the pandemic. The court ruled that ceasing services solely based on a family visit was not permissible, and the provider has been ordered to pay compensation. And now for the weather. Today in Tokyo, expect a warm day with a high of 27 degrees Celsius, a low of 23 degrees, and patchy rain likely throughout the day.
