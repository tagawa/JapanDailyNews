Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on July 7th, 2023. The Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology is urging universities to establish guidelines for the use of AI in educational activities. They are currently working on a notification to be sent to each university. In other news, western to northern Japan is expected to experience intense heat, with Kyoto Prefecture forecasted to reach a dangerous high of 38 degrees Celsius. Strict vigilance against heatstroke is necessary. Meanwhile, there is a possibility of heavy rain in western Japan, including Kyushu, and Hokuriku as the front becomes more active over the next ten days. Please obtain the latest weather information and find a safe place before the rain intensifies. Five years after the devastating torrential rain in western Japan, more than 70% of the victims in Ehime Prefecture still report physical and mental effects. Continuous support for the affected individuals is needed. The Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology continues to investigate the former Unification Church, which gained attention after the incident where former Prime Minister Abe was shot. They are carefully considering whether the requirements for a dissolution order are met. In Tokyo's Nerima ward, a woman in her 40s was seriously injured after being stabbed by a man. The police are investigating the whereabouts of the man who fled the scene, and it is believed that they were acquainted. In an incident at an elementary school in Kurihara City, Miyagi Prefecture, where four children were injured after being hit by a truck that had invaded the school grounds, the 34-year-old suspect, who was arrested on suspicion of attempted murder, stated in the investigation that he intentionally hit them. In a bridge collapse accident at a construction site on a bypass road in Shizuoka City, two people who died were found to have fallen along with the bridge and were trapped between the bridge and the road. The police will conduct on-site verification and thoroughly investigate whether there were any problems with the construction process. Following the accident in which a truck veered into the oncoming lane and collided with an intercity highway bus, resulting in the deaths of five bus passengers in Yawata, Hokkaido last month, repair work has been carried out on the roads in the vicinity of the accident site to prevent a recurrence. And now for the weather. Today in Tokyo, the weather will be sunny with a maximum temperature of 27°C and a minimum temperature of 24°C.  And that's all for today's news. Thanks for listening to Japan Daily News.
