Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on February 22nd, 2024. Today's news brings us updates on various topics from Japan. First, we have news regarding train service on the JR Yokosuka Line. Due to the discovery of multiple concrete fragments in a tunnel between Shinagawa and Shimbashi stations, train operations have been suspended between Shinagawa and Tokyo stations. The railway company is conducting inspections to ensure safety before resuming service.

Moving on, there is information about water supply support in nine cities and towns, including Wajima and Suzu. Scheduled for today, this support aims to address water shortages in the region.

In another development, the Tokyo District Court is holding a hearing today to determine whether to issue a dissolution order for the former Unification Church. This marks the first direct exchange of arguments between the government and the religious organization's representatives. The court will consider the opinions of both sides before making a decision.

In education news, Nikko City in Tochigi Prefecture has decided to introduce a new system starting in the next academic year. Under this system, elementary and middle school students will be allowed to take up to three days off on weekdays to align with their parents' days off.

Moving on to legal matters, twelve individuals residing in Tokyo and other areas plan to file a lawsuit against the government in March. They argue that the provision in the Civil Code that does not recognize separate surnames for married couples is unconstitutional. Although the Supreme Court has twice ruled the provision constitutional, the plaintiffs' legal team contends that societal attitudes have changed and there is an increasing demand for separate surnames.

In a financial news update, four executives of a Singaporean company involved in investment solicitation have been arrested in Japan. They are suspected of conducting investment-related operations without proper registration, a violation of the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act. The police are investigating the flow of funds, which is estimated to be around 135 billion yen collected from approximately 26,000 people nationwide.

Lastly, today is designated as 'Takeshima Day' by Shimane Prefecture. The prefecture asserts that Takeshima, currently occupied by South Korea for the past 70 years, is an inherent part of Japanese territory. In the commemorative ceremony held today, Shimane Prefecture reiterates its claim to Takeshima as Japanese sovereign territory and calls on the national government to seek a resolution to the ongoing situation. And now for the weather. Today in Tokyo, the weather will be light drizzle with a high of 8°C and a low of 5°C.
