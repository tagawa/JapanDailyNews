Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on March 15th, 2024. In a concerning report, it has been revealed that there have been at least 339 cases of children going missing from after-school facilities for children with disabilities over the past five years. Tragically, three children were found dead in rivers. Experts are urging the government to take immediate measures to ensure the safety of children in these facilities.

In another distressing news, the number of elementary school students who have become victims of crimes due to social networking services (SNS) has reached a record high. According to the National Police Agency, there were 139 cases last year, the highest number ever recorded. The incidents range from unintended sexual offenses resulting from profile introductions and friend requests.

Moving on to a historical discovery, parts of a rare Japanese military aircraft known as the 'Renzan' or 'Mountain Range' have been donated to the town of Oizumi in Gunma Prefecture. The town plans to exhibit the parts in future events and exhibitions.

In transportation news, the JR Uchibo Line, which had temporarily suspended operations between Chiba Station and Kisarazu Station due to nighttime inspection delays, has now resumed full service.

However, there is still some disruption on the JR Uchibo Line. Due to construction delays between Anegasaki Station in Ichihara City, Chiba Prefecture, and Yahata-shuku Station, train services between Chiba Station and Kisarazu Station in Chiba Prefecture have been temporarily suspended. The line is expected to reopen around 6 am.

Shifting gears to nature, it has been confirmed that the endangered Oriental white storks, designated as a national natural monument, have laid eggs again this year in Obama City, Fukui Prefecture. This marks the fourth consecutive year of successful breeding.

Lastly, Chubu Electric Power has announced a six-year delay in the decommissioning of Units 1 and 2 at the Hamaoka Nuclear Power Plant in Shizuoka Prefecture. The completion of the decommissioning, originally scheduled for the fiscal year 2036, has been pushed back to the fiscal year 2042. And now for the weather. Today in Tokyo, the weather will be sunny with a high of 15°C and a low of 9°C.  Visit JapanDailyNews.com for the news, yen exchange rates, and a daily Japanese proverb.
