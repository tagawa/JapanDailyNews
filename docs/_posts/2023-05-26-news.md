Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on May 26th, 2023. In Nagano, a man who had been barricaded for 12 hours after firing a gun-like weapon was arrested on suspicion of murder. Four people were confirmed dead, including an elderly woman found near the scene. A powerful typhoon, Typhoon No. 2, is approaching Okinawa and may affect Honshu with rain and other effects. The 40th anniversary of the Japan Sea Central Earthquake, which killed 104 people and caused a large tsunami, is being marked, and experts are warning of the possibility of another earthquake with a similar tsunami. The 'Embankment Regulation Law' comes into effect today, with significantly strengthened penalties of up to 300 million yen for unauthorized embankment work in regulated areas. In the case of a suspect accused of 'thallium murder,' it has been revealed that the suspect had requested to stop the life support of their unconscious aunt. JR Yamanote Line services were suspended due to a person-related accident at Shibuya Station, with the inner loop resuming at 5:25 am and the outer loop still suspended.   And that's all for today's news. Thanks for listening to Japan Daily News.
