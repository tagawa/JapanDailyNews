Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on September 16th, 2023. In today's news, Libya is calling for urgent support from the international community as the country faces massive floods. The local mayor, who has been heavily affected by the floods, reports that approximately 8,000 people have already lost their lives, and there is a risk of even more casualties. The United Nations is urging the international community to provide emergency assistance, including rescue operations and the establishment of medical facilities.

Moving on to weather news, the Japan Meteorological Agency has issued a warning for localized heavy rain accompanied by thunderstorms in western and northern Japan. Due to the influence of a front and moist air, the atmospheric conditions are expected to become unstable on the 16th, with a possibility of intense rainfall and thunderstorms in certain areas. The agency is urging residents to be cautious of potential landslides, flooding in low-lying areas, and other related disasters.

Shifting our focus to Morocco, it has been one week since the devastating earthquake struck the central part of the country. The earthquake has claimed the lives of over 2,900 people and caused damage to 50,000 residential buildings. The major challenge now is to rebuild the lives of the affected communities in the mountainous regions.

In relation to the Morocco earthquake, the Geospatial Information Authority of Japan has analyzed satellite data and found that the ground near the epicenter has uplifted by up to approximately 20 centimeters. This information provides valuable insights into the geological impact of the earthquake.

Turning to a tragic incident in Yokohama, a 33-year-old restaurant manager was found unconscious and bleeding at his establishment. Despite being rushed to the hospital, he was pronounced dead. The police are investigating the case as a possible murder, considering the presence of injuries on the victim's body.

In Aichi Prefecture, a series of incidents involving dangerous objects has raised concerns about safety. Following an accident where a elementary school student suffered a severe foot injury from a nail embedded in the ground at a park in Nishio City, inspections were conducted in schools and parks across the prefecture. Numerous hazardous objects, including nails used as markers for baseball bases, were discovered. Experts in school safety recommend conducting nationwide investigations to ensure the safety of children.

Lastly, in an unfortunate incident involving a police officer, the 57-year-old chief of a police station in Aichi Prefecture was reported to have consumed alcohol along with several subordinates, including a female police officer, at his official residence. Some of the officers became heavily intoxicated, leading to a disturbance that resulted in a 110 emergency call. As a consequence, the chief has been transferred to another post, and further investigations will be conducted to determine the details of the incident.

That's all for today's news. Thank you for joining us on Japan Daily News. Stay tuned for more updates. And now for the weather. Today in Tokyo, the weather will be partly cloudy with a chance of rain. The average temperature will be 28 degrees Celsius.  And that's all for today's news.
