Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on July 28th, 2023. In today's news, heavy rain in Akita City has caused significant damage to the trails on Mount Taihei, leading to the closure of a mountain hut for the season. It is estimated that the restoration of the trails will take several years. Moving on to health news, today is World Hepatitis Day, and efforts are being made to raise awareness about the prevention and treatment of hepatitis. According to a survey conducted by the Japan Society of Hepatology, the proportion of alcoholic liver disease has decreased over the past four years, while the proportion of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease caused by factors such as alcohol, obesity, and sedentary lifestyle has increased. The rising trend of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is a cause for concern and highlights the importance of a healthy lifestyle. As we shift our focus to weather, extreme heat continues to persist in Kyoto and Oita, with temperatures expected to reach 39 degrees Celsius. It is crucial to take precautions against heatstroke, such as staying hydrated and using air conditioning. In other news, new developments have emerged in the Sapporo Susukino dismemberment case. Clothing and a blonde wig, believed to have been used for disguise by the 29-year-old daughter during her escape, have been seized from their residence. The investigation into this gruesome crime is ongoing. Shifting gears to labor issues, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare's advisory panel is in the final stages of discussing the minimum wage for this fiscal year. It is anticipated that adjustments will be made to raise the hourly rate to the 1000 yen range, taking into account the rising cost of living. Turning our attention to natural disasters, Typhoon 6 has formed in the waters east of the Philippines. There is a possibility that the typhoon will strengthen and approach Okinawa Prefecture, so it is important to stay updated on the latest information. Lastly, the No. 1 reactor at the Takahama Nuclear Power Plant in Fukui Prefecture will resume operations today after a 12-year hiatus. This is the oldest nuclear power plant in Japan and will exceed the 40-year operating limit, becoming the second facility in the country to do so. That's all for today's news. Thank you for tuning in to Japan Daily News. And now for the weather. Today in Tokyo, the weather will be sunny with a high of 29°C and a low of 27°C.  And that's all for today's news. Thanks for listening to Japan Daily News.
