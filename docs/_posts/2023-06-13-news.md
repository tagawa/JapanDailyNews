### Transcript

Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on June 13th, 2023. The Maritime Self-Defense Force conducted joint exercises with the US and French navies in the Pacific Ocean and East China Sea, with the aim of deterring China's maritime expansion. Kansai Electric Power Company's president met with the governor of Fukui prefecture to discuss plans to transport some of the spent fuel from local nuclear power plants to France, but the majority of the plan remains uncertain. A police officer was hospitalized after a patrol car overturned in a collision with a light vehicle in Joetsu, Niigata. The pre-trial hearing for the trial of Tetsuya Yamagami, who is accused of murder in the shooting of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, was postponed due to a suspicious package containing a petition to reduce Yamagami's sentence. Seibu Railway resumed operations on the Shinjuku and Hachioji lines after suspending them due to a human accident. The draft of this year's "Traffic Safety White Paper" emphasizes the importance of wearing a helmet while cycling and introduces local measures to reduce the high mortality rate of those who do not wear helmets. A 26-year-old suspect in the robbery of a watch store near Kawasaki Station reportedly applied for the job through a social media recruitment post, raising the possibility of involvement in an underground job. And now for the weather. Today in Tokyo, it will be mostly cloudy with a high of 24°C and a low of 22°C, and a chance of light rain showers throughout the day.  And that's all for today's news. Thanks for listening to Japan Daily News.
