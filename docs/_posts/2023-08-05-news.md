Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on August 5th, 2023. In today's news, the Japanese government is planning to conduct a comprehensive investigation into the contamination of PFAS, a group of organic fluorine compounds that have been identified as potentially harmful. The Ministry of the Environment's expert panel has recommended the implementation of a thorough examination of blood concentration levels to determine the extent of PFAS exposure. This investigation aims to better understand the amount of PFAS that has entered the human body.

Moving on to our next story, Typhoon 6 is once again approaching the Okinawa and Amami regions. Residents in these areas are advised to exercise extreme caution as strong winds, high waves, and high tides are expected. There is also a possibility of a continuous formation of a rain band, known as a 'linear precipitation zone,' which could result in heavy rainfall. Please stay updated with the latest weather information and take necessary precautions.

In other news, a member of the Liberal Democratic Party, Representative Akimoto, has been repeatedly urging for a review of the bidding process for a wind power project off the coast of Akita Prefecture. Representative Akimoto's office was searched due to suspicions of receiving bribes related to offshore wind power generation. The company involved in the bribery scandal has expressed interest in participating in the Akita project. The Tokyo District Public Prosecutors Office's Special Investigation Department is currently examining the details of the parliamentary questioning.

As the heatwave continues, Japan is experiencing dangerously high temperatures, with several regions in Eastern and Western Japan expecting temperatures above 38 degrees Celsius. It is crucial to remain vigilant against heatstroke. On the other hand, due to the influence of a front, heavy rain is forecasted for the Japan Sea side of Hokkaido, with intermittent heavy rain and a risk of landslides.

Furthermore, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare has revealed that over 7,200 cases of legal violations were found in Japanese companies that accepted foreign technical trainees. These violations include insufficient safety measures during work and unpaid overtime wages. The Ministry has been monitoring the compliance of these companies, and the number of violations has exceeded 7,200 in the past year.

Lastly, a hospital in Kobe has decided to request a third-party verification for two patients who died after undergoing catheter procedures. The hospital will utilize the medical accident investigation system established by the national government to investigate the causes of the deaths that occurred in January and February of this year. And now for the weather. Today in Tokyo, the weather will be partly cloudy with a high of 29°C and a low of 28°C. There is a chance of patchy rain in the morning and a UV index of 7. Enjoy your day!  And that's all for today's news. Thanks for listening to Japan Daily News.
