Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on September 13th, 2024. In today's news, Typhoon 13 is expected to approach the Amami and Okinawa regions with strong force tomorrow. The Japan Meteorological Agency has issued warnings about the possibility of fierce winds, high waves, and potential landslides, urging residents to take precautions against flooding in low-lying areas and rising river levels.

Shifting gears, Kagawa Prefecture is making strides in addressing the shortage of public transport drivers due to an aging population. Starting from September 12, automated bus trials have begun on Shodoshima Island. Prior to the launch, local middle school students participated in a trial ride on September 11, giving them a firsthand experience of this innovative transportation solution.

In other news, the Hakata region in Fukuoka City is celebrating one of its three major festivals, the Hojyo Festival, which kicked off on September 12 at Hakozaki Shrine. This vibrant event brings together the community in a celebration of culture and tradition.

In a more serious update, the police have decided to continue the designation of a 28-year-old suspect as an important wanted individual in connection with a hit-and-run incident that resulted in the death of a university student in Beppu City two years ago. Authorities are actively seeking information to locate the suspect.

On the international front, Japan's Ministry of Defense reported that two Russian military reconnaissance aircraft have flown around the Japanese archipelago. This follows announcements from the Russian Ministry of Defense about ongoing military exercises in the Pacific since September 10, prompting heightened vigilance from Japanese authorities.

Lastly, there's an exciting initiative from the Ministry of Education that could lead to more Olympic athletes becoming teachers. The ministry is establishing new measures to facilitate the hiring of athletes with Olympic experience as teachers, even if they do not hold teaching licenses. This initiative aims to provide children with the opportunity to learn from accomplished athletes. And now for the weather. Today in Tokyo, expect a warm day with a high of 32 degrees Celsius, lots of sunshine, and a chance of patchy rain later.
