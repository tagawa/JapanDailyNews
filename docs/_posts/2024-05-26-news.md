Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on May 26th, 2024. In today's news, a tropical depression near the Philippines is expected to become a typhoon and approach the Okinawa region of Japan after the 29th. The Japan Meteorological Agency has issued a warning for high waves and strong winds, urging caution. Moving on to another story, a 4-year-old girl was found unconscious in a reservoir in Gero City, Gifu Prefecture.

In other news, a man was stabbed in the abdomen and rendered unconscious in the parking lot of a pachinko parlor in Tokushima City.

Shifting our focus, five people have been arrested on suspicion of abandoning a body in a suitcase recovered from the Tama River in Kawasaki City. The body was identified as a 46-year-old man from Tokyo. The police believe there may have been some trouble between the man and the daughter of a divorced couple in her 50s, who are among those arrested. One of the suspects has denied the allegations. In Fukuoka, a taxi accident occurred in the downtown area near Tenjin, injuring three women. They suffered minor injuries, including head trauma. Turning to natural events, an earthquake with a magnitude of 3 was felt in a wide area of Kanto, including the 23 wards of Tokyo, early this morning. Fortunately, there is no concern for a tsunami.
