Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on October 6th, 2024. A recent survey conducted by a private organization reveals significant differences in parental attitudes towards children's university education based on gender. The findings indicate that parents are more likely to express a desire for their daughters to remain close to home, while they hope for their sons to achieve higher incomes. Experts in education emphasize the importance of allowing individuals to make their own choices, regardless of gender, to avoid limiting their options.

In another noteworthy event, a lecture on how to cope with dementia was held in Tokyo. The discussion centered on the challenges faced by individuals with dementia and their families. A specialist in the field urged attendees to discard outdated beliefs that individuals with dementia are incapable of contributing to society. Instead, he highlighted the necessity for community understanding and support.

On the environmental front, a concerning report from Japan's Ministry of the Environment and the Japan Nature Conservation Association indicates that 16 species of birds, including sparrows, are rapidly declining in population and are now classified as endangered. This alarming trend is particularly evident in rural areas, where these birds are traditionally found.

In other news, renowned culinary critic Yukio Hattori passed away at the age of 78 after collapsing at the cooking school he led. Hattori was a familiar face on television cooking programs and was a staunch advocate for food education throughout his career.

In Hamamatsu, Shizuoka Prefecture, authorities have issued evacuation information for nearly 19,000 households in the Horidome River basin due to the heightened risk of landslides and flooding from heavy rainfall. Residents, particularly the elderly and those with disabilities, are being urged to evacuate as a precautionary measure.

In Hokkaido, a training session was held to implement QR code technology aimed at the early detection of elderly individuals with dementia who go missing. Participants learned how to use smartphone applications to scan QR codes attached to clothing, allowing for quicker identification and assistance.

Finally, it has been two weeks since the record-breaking rains in Ishikawa Prefecture, which led to significant evacuations. In Wajima and Suzu cities, experts have found that nearly 1,900 areas experienced landslides, comparable to damage from the Noto Peninsula earthquake earlier this year. Currently, over 490 residents are still living in evacuation shelters as recovery efforts continue. And now for the weather. Today in Tokyo, expect a warm day with temperatures around 22 degrees Celsius, patchy rain nearby, and overcast skies.
