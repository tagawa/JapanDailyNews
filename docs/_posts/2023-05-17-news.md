### Transcript

Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on May 17th, 2023. Today, a number of news stories have caught our attention. Firstly, the Keisei Chiba Line has resumed operations following a temporary suspension due to a personal injury accident. Secondly, the Kanto region is expected to experience its hottest day of the year so far, with temperatures exceeding 35 degrees Celsius, so it is important to take precautions against heatstroke. Unfortunately, there have also been some tragic incidents, such as a collision between a truck and a bus on the Tohoku Expressway in Miyagi Prefecture, which resulted in the deaths of three people. In Saitama Prefecture, the body of a newborn baby girl was found in an irrigation ditch, and the police are investigating it as a case of abandonment. In addition, a Chinese navy vessel engaged in information gathering was spotted circumnavigating Japan for the second time in a month, prompting the Japanese Ministry of Defense to remain vigilant. Finally, Japan Travel has admitted to fraudulently claiming approximately 5.3 million yen in personnel expenses related to a campaign to stimulate tourism demand in Aichi Prefecture. And tragically, a young boy was hit and killed by a truck in Adachi Ward, Tokyo, and the driver has been arrested. Today in Tokyo, it will be mostly sunny with temperatures ranging from 21 to 24 degrees Celsius (70 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit) and a low chance of precipitation.  And that's all for today's news. Thanks for listening to Japan Daily News.
