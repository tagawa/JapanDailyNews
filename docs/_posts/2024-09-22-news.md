Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on September 22nd, 2024. In Ishikawa Prefecture, a special emergency warning for heavy rain has been issued as a low-pressure system, previously a typhoon, approaches the Noto region. This has led to concerns over flooding and landslides, prompting authorities to maintain the highest level of alert. Residents are advised to avoid unnecessary travel as severe rain is expected to continue. The Japan Meteorological Agency has noted that the rainfall has been record-breaking, and warnings extend beyond Ishikawa to regions from Tohoku to Kyushu, where thunderstorms and intense rainfall could also lead to similar dangers.

In related news, a landslide near a tunnel in Wajima City has left three workers unaccounted for. These workers were engaged in recovery efforts following the Noto Peninsula earthquake. Search operations were temporarily halted due to the risk of secondary disasters but are set to resume around 11 AM today. The police and fire departments are coordinating these efforts.

Additionally, four houses along the Tsukadagawa River in Wajima have been swept away by floodwaters, with four residents currently unreachable. Authorities have initiated search operations this morning to locate them.

On a transportation note, the Yamagata Shinkansen has suspended all services between Yamagata and Shinjo for the entire day due to the ongoing heavy rain. This disruption is part of a broader impact from the severe weather affecting multiple regions. And now for the weather. Today in Tokyo, it will be warm with a high of 30 degrees Celsius and a chance of patchy rain, especially in the afternoon.
