### Transcript

Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on July 19th, 2023. In our top stories today,

North Korea has fired two ballistic missiles, which are estimated to have fallen outside of Japan's Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). The Japanese Ministry of Defense announced that the missiles were launched early this morning and both fell outside of Japan's EEZ. This comes after North Korea launched an ICBM (Intercontinental Ballistic Missile) earlier this month, prompting continued vigilance and surveillance by the Ministry of Defense.

As we continue to experience scorching temperatures, heatstroke precautions remain a priority. Today, severe heat is expected in western and eastern Japan, so please take necessary measures to prevent heatstroke. Additionally, due to the influence of a front, heavy rain is forecasted in the Tohoku region from tomorrow. Please be cautious of landslides, river flooding, and inundation.

Moving on to other news,

The Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology is demanding strict measures and conducting investigations into cases of misconduct by teachers involving child molestation. Following the establishment of new offenses such as the 'meeting request crime,' which involves demanding meetings or sending images to children for the purpose of sexual harassment, the ministry is urging education boards to handle such cases rigorously and is also conducting a survey on the disciplinary standards of local governments.

In a recent development,

It has been revealed that actor Ichikawa Sarunoshin, who was arrested for assisting his father's suicide, had searched for specific methods of suicide using sleeping pills on his smartphone the day before his parents were found unconscious. The investigation has uncovered this information from interviews with individuals involved.

Shifting gears,

In the ongoing scandal involving used car sales company 'Big Motor,' the company has announced disciplinary actions against its president and others for intentionally damaging cars and making fraudulent insurance claims. The company has pledged to work towards preventing future incidents under the current management. However, the lack of detailed explanations from the management team raises questions about how they will address customer and business partner concerns.

In the entertainment industry,

Former talents of Johnny's Entertainment, the talent agency, have formed a group to address the issue of sexual harassment allegations against the former president of the agency. During a meeting held on the evening of the 18th, the group confirmed their intention to demand recognition and an apology from the agency for the incidents of sexual harassment that occurred.

In response to the ongoing scandal,

Johnny's Entertainment has established a dedicated contact point for information related to the sexual misconduct committed by the former president. The agency has set up a special team consisting of external experts to prevent future incidents and has opened a dedicated window to receive information regarding sexual misconduct.
