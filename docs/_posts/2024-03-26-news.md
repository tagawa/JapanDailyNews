Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on March 26th, 2024. In today's news, train service has resumed on the JR Joban Line after a temporary suspension due to a door malfunction. The suspension affected the section between Ayase and Matsudo stations, but as of 8:40 a.m., trains are running again. In other news, a 30-year-old Vietnamese man was fatally stabbed in an apartment in Kasukabe City, Saitama Prefecture. The suspect, a 24-year-old Vietnamese man who lived with the victim, has been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder. He denies the allegations. Moving on, heavy rain is expected in eastern and western Japan, prompting warnings of potential disasters. The rain, caused by a front and a low-pressure system, has been intensifying since this morning. Finally, in the ongoing issue involving Kobayashi Pharmaceuticals' 'Koujiku' health supplement, it has been revealed that it took over two months from the first reported case to the voluntary recall announcement. The company is now working to understand the extent of the health damage caused. Additionally, it has been confirmed that a total of 26 people have been hospitalized after consuming the product. However, Dr. Rei Shibata, a specialist in internal medicine at Nagoya University, emphasizes that 'Koujiku' itself is not necessarily the culprit and urges consumers to remain calm. Please note that the article includes information about the health consultation desk set up by Kobayashi Pharmaceuticals for those experiencing health issues. And now for the weather. Today in Tokyo, the weather will be around 11 degrees Celsius with light drizzle in the morning and patchy rain nearby in the afternoon. The humidity will be around 87% and there is a 100% chance of rain. The wind speed will be around 12-24 km/h.
