Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on March 16th, 2024. In today's news, the new section of the Hokuriku Shinkansen line between Kanazawa and Tsuruga has opened. The first train departed from Tsuruga Station in Fukui Prefecture towards Tokyo Station after 6 a.m. This new line is expected to boost tourism in the region. Meanwhile, a volunteer group from Ogano Town in Saitama Prefecture has purchased a light truck to support the recovery efforts of the Noto Peninsula earthquake. The truck has departed for Ishikawa Prefecture. In other news, Narita Airport Corporation plans to establish a new company to attract foreign tourists to the areas surrounding the airport, as the number of foreign visitors using Narita Airport continues to rise. Moving on, we remember a talented young artist, a 36-year-old Wajima lacquerware craftsman, whose unique creations were unfortunately lost in a fire after an earthquake. However, some of his remaining works have been shared by acquaintances. Next, industrial robot leader Fanuc has been accused of underreporting approximately 9.7 billion yen in income. The Tokyo Regional Taxation Bureau found that Fanuc had been selling parts to its subsidiary in Taiwan at lower prices, thereby transferring profits overseas. Fanuc has stated that there are differences in interpretation with the authorities. Finally, on the 15th anniversary of a tragic accident, family members and others gathered near the manual level crossing near Takenotsuka Station in Adachi, Tokyo, where two people were fatally struck by a train. And in Ibaraki Prefecture, a head-on collision between two vehicles on National Route 6 resulted in the death of two women in their 90s who were passengers in a day service transport vehicle. Three others were injured in the accident. And now for the weather. Today in Tokyo, the weather will be sunny with a maximum temperature of 18°C and a minimum temperature of 12°C.
