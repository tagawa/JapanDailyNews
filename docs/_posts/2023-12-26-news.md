Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on December 26th, 2023. In today's news, train service on the Keio Inokashira Line has been suspended due to a personal accident at Kichijoji Station. The suspension is in effect between Fujimigahara and Kichijoji stations since around 6:36 am, and the service is expected to resume around 7:40 am, according to Keio Electric Railway.

Moving on to our next story, a new law has been enacted regarding the management of assets of religious corporations for the relief of victims of the former Unification Church. In response to this, the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology has decided to establish new criteria for designating religious corporations to assess their asset status.

Shifting gears, the Japanese government is planning to export the Patriot surface-to-air missile system after easing the rules on defense equipment exports. The Self-Defense Forces will export the system to the United States, and comprehensive coordination with the US side will begin after the new year.

In other news, a house fire in Fukaya, Saitama has left a single elderly man in his 70s unaccounted for. The police are currently investigating the situation.

Moving on to Tokyo, a fire broke out in a restaurant in a shopping street near JR Akabane Station, resulting in the destruction of four buildings, including the restaurant. Two people suffered minor injuries, and the fire was extinguished after approximately seven hours.

In Tottori, three individuals, a man and two women, who were believed to be mountain climbing on Mount Daisen, have been out of contact since the 25th. The police suspect they may be in a distress situation and have initiated a search operation starting this morning.

Lastly, in Ashikaga, Tochigi, a man in his 50s has been arrested on suspicion of abandoning the body of his 80-year-old mother at their residence. And now for the weather.
