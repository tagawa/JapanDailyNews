Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on July 17th, 2024. In today's news, a Japanese soccer player who participated in this year's Asian Cup has been arrested on suspicion of sexually assaulting a woman in a hotel in Tokyo. The player, Kaisen Sano, was a member of the national team and is now in custody. Moving on to weather news, the Kanto-Koshinetsu region is facing the possibility of heavy rain accompanied by thunderstorms tonight. The Meteorological Agency has issued warnings for potential landslides, flooding in low-lying areas, and rising river levels. Residents are urged to exercise caution and take necessary precautions. In other news, the Japanese government is considering withdrawing its claim regarding the 'exclusion period' in a separate trial related to the old Eugenic Protection Law. This claim states that after 20 years, individuals cannot seek compensation for illegal acts. The government's decision comes after a recent Supreme Court ruling. Shifting gears to a natural disaster, experts from Ehime University have conducted an on-site investigation into the landslide that claimed three lives in Matsuyama City on July 12th. Preliminary findings suggest that multiple factors contributed to the incident, making it a complex issue that requires further examination. Tragic news from Fukushima, where a 2-year-old girl was fatally struck by a car driven by her mother on the evening of July 16th. The accident is currently under investigation. In Gifu Prefecture, the city of Tajimi has issued evacuation information for 2,779 households and 5,708 people in the Ikeda-cho area due to the high risk of landslides caused by heavy rainfall. The city has declared a Level 3 alert, urging the elderly and individuals with disabilities to begin evacuation measures. Finally, in Morioka City, a high school student was injured during a javelin practice session. The javelin rebounded and accidentally pierced the student's neck. They were immediately transported to the hospital, and their condition is being investigated by the police. That's all for today's news. Thank you for listening to Japan Daily News. And now for the weather. Today in Tokyo, the weather will be partly cloudy with a maximum temperature of 30°C and a minimum temperature of 23°C. There is a chance of light rain showers throughout the day.  Visit JapanDailyNews.com for the news, yen exchange rates, and a daily Japanese proverb.
