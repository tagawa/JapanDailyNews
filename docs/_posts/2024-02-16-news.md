Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on February 16th, 2024. In our top stories today, the JR Joban Line has resumed service after being temporarily suspended due to strong winds. The line, which runs between Abiko Station in Chiba Prefecture and Toride Station in Ibaraki Prefecture, had suspended operations earlier but resumed at 7:36 am. 

Moving on to our next story, in the murder case of a 64-year-old piano teacher in Imabari City, Ehime Prefecture, the police are planning to rearrest the suspect. The suspect, who was previously arrested for assaulting the victim's second daughter on the same day of the incident, is now believed to have restrained a middle school student who was present at the piano studio in the victim's house. The police have confirmed this information through interviews with investigators.

In other news, an elderly couple was found dead in an apartment room in Minuma Ward, Saitama City. The police are investigating the circumstances of their deaths, including the possibility of a joint suicide based on the condition of the scene. 

Moving on, the closed-door trial for the second retrial request in the Iizuka case has concluded. The Iizuka case refers to the murder of two elementary school girls in Iizuka City, Fukuoka Prefecture 32 years ago. The family of the former death row inmate, whose execution has already been carried out, has requested a retrial. The court is expected to make a decision on whether to grant the retrial request in April or later.

Back to transportation news, the JR Joban Line has also experienced service disruptions due to strong winds. The line has been suspended between Abiko Station in Chiba Prefecture and Toride Station in Ibaraki Prefecture since early morning, with no estimated time for resumption of service.

In a tragic case in Hachinohe, Aomori Prefecture, a 21-year-old mother and a 31-year-old man living with her were arrested on suspicion of causing the death of their 5-year-old daughter by exposing her to cold water in a bathtub. According to sources close to the investigation, the abuse began after the family moved out of the suspect's relatives' house around November last year and started living with only the mother, the suspect, and the victim. 

Lastly, in the case of the double murder in Sagamihara City, it has been revealed that the mother also had injuries consistent with being stabbed. The couple in their 50s was found dead in their apartment, and their teenage son has been arrested on suspicion of killing his father. The police are now investigating the mother's death and suspect the involvement of the son.
