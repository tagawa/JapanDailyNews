Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on October 31st, 2023. In today's news, let's start with the latest economic update. According to the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications, the unemployment rate in September improved by 0.1 percentage points to 2.6%. This marks a positive trend in the job market.

Moving on to the employment situation, the job availability ratio in September remained steady at 1.29 times the number of job seekers. The Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare has expressed the need to monitor the situation closely as the number of new job openings decreased compared to the previous month.

Now, let's shift our focus to the Halloween festivities. With Halloween being celebrated today, the Shibuya ward in Tokyo is urging people not to visit the area due to concerns of potential accidents and overcrowding. The authorities have implemented extensive measures to ensure public safety.

Shifting gears to the healthcare sector, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare has proposed a new service to address the shortage of caregivers in the field of home care. The proposal aims to integrate home care and day service care under one organization, allowing the utilization of staff across both types of care.

Next, let's talk about the future of the former Tsukiji Fish Market site in Tokyo, also known as the 'Kitchen of Japan.' Two potential plans have emerged for the vast vacant area. One plan suggests developing facilities for hosting professional sports events, while the other envisions a facility dedicated to Japanese anime, games, and related industries.

In other news, an incident involving a wild boar occurred in Fukuoka. The boar was spotted in a residential and commercial area in Hakata Ward, and after approximately 5 and a half hours, it was captured by the police. Fortunately, no injuries were reported.

Lastly, the G7 countries, in their pursuit of establishing common rules for the utilization and regulation of AI, have reached an agreement on a code of conduct and guidelines specifically targeting AI developers. The aim is to develop and implement methods to distinguish content created by AI systems.

That's all for today's news. Thank you for listening to Japan Daily News. Stay tuned for more updates. And now for the weather. Today in Tokyo, the weather will be partly cloudy with a maximum temperature of 21°C and a minimum temperature of 18°C. There is a 47% chance of overcast skies and a 79% chance of sunshine. The UV index is 4, indicating moderate UV levels. No rain or snow is expected. Enjoy your day!  Visit JapanDailyNews.com for the news, yen exchange rates, and a daily Japanese proverb.
