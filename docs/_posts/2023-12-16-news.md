Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on December 16th, 2023. In today's news, a recent study conducted by a group of researchers from Kinki University and other institutions revealed that approximately half of lung cancer patients in Japan have not undergone genetic testing to identify the most suitable medications for their condition. The study highlights the need for wider awareness and accessibility of genetic testing in the country. Moving on to weather news, a rapidly developing low-pressure system is expected to bring severe weather conditions to northern and eastern Japan starting this evening and continuing until the day after tomorrow. Strong winds and heavy snowfall are anticipated, posing potential risks such as storm damage, high waves, and transportation disruptions. Please exercise caution and stay updated with the latest weather advisories. In other news, the recent outbreak of infectious diseases among children has put a strain on childcare services provided by non-profit organizations. Due to the prevalence of infections such as influenza, NPOs are struggling to meet the overwhelming demand for childcare. Meanwhile, schools are implementing online learning and review sessions during closures to ensure educational continuity. On the law enforcement front, police departments in four prefectures across Japan conducted simultaneous inspections of host clubs in response to a series of disputes involving female customers being charged exorbitant fees and the subsequent repayment issues. The authorities are taking action to address the problem and protect consumers. In transportation news, the temporary closure of the Tokyo Bay Aqua-Line due to strong winds has been lifted as of last night. However, earlier in the day, the Aqua-Line was closed in both directions between Kawasaki Ukishima Junction and Kisarazu-Kanada Interchange on the downline, and between Sodegaura Interchange and Kawasaki Ukishima Junction on the upline due to the same weather conditions. Lastly, the Ministry of Defense has suspended two companies from bidding for military contracts after they were found attempting to resell decommissioned vehicles instead of properly disposing of them. That's all for today's news. Thank you for listening to Japan Daily News. And now for the weather. Today in Tokyo, the weather will be mostly sunny with a high of 20°C and a low of 13°C. There is a 0% chance of rain and a 5 UV index.  Visit JapanDailyNews.com for the news, yen exchange rates, and a daily Japanese proverb.
