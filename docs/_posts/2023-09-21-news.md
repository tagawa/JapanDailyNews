### Transcript

Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on September 21st, 2023. In today's news, we have several stories from Japan.

First, the East Japan Railway Company (JR) has announced that the Tohoku Shinkansen, the high-speed train line connecting Tokyo and northeastern Japan, experienced delays due to abnormal noises. The trains between Omiya and Sendai stations were temporarily suspended, but service has now resumed. However, there are still some delays on certain trains between Tokyo and Morioka stations.

In another story related to the Tohoku Shinkansen, train operations between Omiya and Sendai stations were halted due to the confirmation of abnormal noises between Koriyama and Fukushima stations. The suspension of service is expected to be lifted around 9:00 am.

Moving on to weather news, heavy rainfall is expected in the Tohoku and Kyushu regions overnight and into tomorrow. Warm and moist air is flowing towards a front extending from a low-pressure system, resulting in localized heavy rain in Kyushu. As the low-pressure system and front pass through from the 22nd, there is a risk of heavy rain in various parts of Japan, including Tohoku and Kyushu. Authorities are urging caution against flooding and landslides.

In a tragic incident on the Tokyo Metropolitan Expressway, a trailer caught fire, and the driver, who had exited the vehicle, was fatally struck by a truck from behind. There is also information suggesting that another vehicle collided with the driver before leaving the scene, leading the police to investigate the possibility of a hit-and-run.

On a lighter note, the Imperial Family visited the largest traditional craft exhibition in Japan held in Tokyo on the evening of the 20th. The Emperor and Empress had the opportunity to admire the exquisite craftsmanship showcased at the event.

Lastly, as the COVID-19 restrictions are lifted and social activities resume, there has been a significant increase in serious accidents caused by drunk driving. In response, the police across the country have announced that they will focus on cracking down on drunk driving during the Autumn National Traffic Safety Campaign, which begins on the 21st.

That's all for today's news from Japan Daily News. Stay tuned for more updates on tomorrow's episode.   And that's all for today's news. Thanks for listening to Japan Daily News.
