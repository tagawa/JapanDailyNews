### Transcript

Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on May 19th, 2023. In earthquake news, a 4.0 magnitude earthquake was observed in Ehime Prefecture with no tsunami warning. In other news, the Oita District Court has been found to have destroyed court records, including those of high-profile cases, due to the expiration of the retention period. Meanwhile, police investigated suspicious bags filled with harmless liquids found on train platforms in Yokohama and Kawasaki. In pet news, cooking school students in Oita have developed recipes for pet food using locally available ingredients in case of natural disasters. On the health front, there have been reports of mass influenza infections in multiple schools across Japan, including a Tokyo elementary school with 104 cases and a private high school in Oita with 500 cases. Additionally, nearly half of the 380 fixed-term researchers at the prestigious RIKEN research institute did not have their contracts renewed. And now for the weather. Today in Tokyo, it will be partly cloudy with a high of 21°C (70°F) and a low of 18°C (64°F). There is a chance of rain in the afternoon and evening.  And that's all for today's news. Thanks for listening to Japan Daily News.
