Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on November 22nd, 2023. In today's news, the Tokyo Metropolitan Police are investigating a hit-and-run incident in Edogawa Ward, where a 44-year-old man was found dead on the street. It is believed that the man was hit by a car, and the police are treating it as a hit-and-run case. In another story, a 37-year-old male babysitter has been arrested by the Tokyo Metropolitan Police on suspicion of committing lewd acts on two young sisters at their home. The police found explicit images of the girls on the babysitter's computer and are conducting further investigations. Moving on to natural disasters, the Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology (JAMSTEC) has confirmed the presence of a caldera-like structure on the seabed near Torishima Island, which was formed by volcanic activity. Although the connection to the tsunami generated by an earthquake last month is unclear, experts believe that the underwater volcano discovered during the investigation could be a possible source of the seismic waves. In transportation news, Nagoya Railway has implemented an AI-based video analysis system to detect abnormalities at railway crossings and alert train operators, aiming to prevent collisions between trains and pedestrians or vehicles. Shifting to crime news, four individuals, including a 21-year-old suspect, have been arrested for illegally selling over-the-counter drugs near the 'Toyo Yoko' area in Shinjuku's Kabukicho district. With concerns about excessive consumption of over-the-counter drugs among young people, the Tokyo Metropolitan Police suspect that the suspects repeatedly engaged in illegal sales to minors and are investigating the source of the drugs. In international news, seven Japanese nationals suspected of being involved in a sophisticated fraud scheme were arrested in Malaysia. When the local police raided their base, they discovered that multiple electronic devices had been destroyed, leading them to believe that the fraud group was attempting to conceal evidence. The local police are conducting a detailed examination of the seized evidence. Lastly, the Ministry of Defense has announced that a ballistic missile, possibly from North Korea, was launched. The government issued an alert through the nationwide J-Alert system, stating that the missile passed over the Pacific Ocean at approximately 10:55 PM on the 21st. We have compiled an overview of the situation in Okinawa and Kagoshima prefectures. That's all for today's news. Thank you for listening to Japan Daily News. And now for the weather. Today in Tokyo, the weather will be sunny with a high of 18°C and a low of 13°C.  Visit JapanDailyNews.com for the news, yen exchange rates, and a daily Japanese proverb.
