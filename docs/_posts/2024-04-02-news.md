Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on April 2nd, 2024. The official Instagram account of the Imperial Household Agency has gained over 350,000 followers on its first day of operation. The agency expressed its commitment to provide information that meets the expectations of its followers. In other news, an earthquake with a magnitude of 4.9 was observed in Aomori and Iwate Prefectures early this morning. The Japan Meteorological Agency has urged residents in areas with strong shaking to be cautious of earthquakes with a magnitude of around 4.9 for the next week. Moving on, the Tohoku Shinkansen line has suspended operations between Tokyo and Sendai due to a breakdown of a construction vehicle at Fukushima Station. The suspension is currently in effect. In health-related news, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare announced that a total of 157 people have been hospitalized due to illnesses caused by consuming health supplements containing 'Kouji' produced by Kobayashi Pharmaceutical. Shifting gears, the town of Oki in Shimane Prefecture is currently in full bloom with over 10,000 narcissus flowers along the rivers and agricultural roads. A fundraising event for the earthquake-stricken areas of the Noto Peninsula was also held in the area. Additionally, the large-scale tourism campaign 'Fukuoka-Oita Destination Campaign' has begun, and in the city of Yufu in Oita Prefecture, popular 'Tsujibasha' horse-drawn carriages have been replaced with new carriages in anticipation of a large number of tourists. Lastly, the fishing season for 'Shiroebi,' also known as the 'jewel of Toyama Bay,' has started, and fresh Shiroebi have been caught one after another at the fishing port in Imizu City, Toyama Prefecture. Despite concerns about the impact of the Noto Peninsula earthquake, no troubles have been reported. And now for the weather. The weather in Tokyo today is sunny with a maximum temperature of 17°C and a minimum temperature of 11°C. There is no chance of rain and the UV index is 5.
