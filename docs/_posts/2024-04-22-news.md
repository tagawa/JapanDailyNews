Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on April 22nd, 2024. In today's news, we have two significant stories coming from Japan.

First, train services on the JR Chuo Line have been suspended due to a personal accident. According to JR East, the rapid trains on the Chuo Line between Tokyo Station and Takao Station have been temporarily halted since around 8:10 a.m. due to an incident at Hino Station. The services are expected to resume around 9:10 a.m.

Moving on to our second story, measures are being taken to address the uneven distribution of doctors and ensure the appropriate allocation of limited medical resources. The advisory body to the Minister of Finance has recommended adjusting the unit price of medical fees paid to healthcare facilities. In areas where there is a shortage of doctors, the fees would be increased, while in areas with an excess of doctors, the fees would be decreased.

These are the top stories for today. Stay tuned for more news updates from Japan Daily News. And now for the weather. Today in Tokyo, there will be light rain with temperatures ranging from 14 to 17 degrees Celsius.  Visit JapanDailyNews.com for the news, yen exchange rates, and a daily Japanese proverb.
