Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on September 11th, 2024. In a tragic incident in Yokohama, a fire broke out late on the night of September 10th in a building that served as both a residence and an office. Authorities discovered two bodies in the charred remains of the structure, and police are working to confirm that the deceased are an 88-year-old woman and her 55-year-old daughter, who had been uncontactable since the fire.

Meanwhile, in Utsunomiya, a fire early on the same day engulfed a two-story building that housed a restaurant on the first floor. A 23-year-old woman who worked at the restaurant and her four-month-old son were found in critical condition and remain unconscious in the hospital. Investigations are ongoing to determine the cause of both fires.

In a separate matter, it has been ten years since the arrest of the leader of the Kudo-kai, a designated dangerous organized crime group in Kitakyushu. Since the start of the police's extensive investigations, the number of Kudo-kai members has decreased to a quarter of its peak. However, despite these efforts, the group is still suspected of involvement in various criminal activities, prompting police to intensify their operations aimed at dismantling the organization.

In another unfortunate report, a man was found bleeding and unconscious at a residential complex in Kawaguchi, Saitama Prefecture, on the evening of September 10th. He was later pronounced dead at the hospital. Police have arrested a 61-year-old male resident of the complex on suspicion of attempted murder, and investigations are underway to uncover the details surrounding the incident.

On a lighter note, today marks the 58th birthday of Princess Kiko, the wife of Prince Akishino. In a written response to reporters, she reflected on her special day.

Turning to international news, Typhoon 11 has wreaked havoc across parts of Asia, particularly in Vietnam, where the death toll has reached 127. Combined with casualties from the Philippines and China, the total number of fatalities has surpassed 150. The devastating impact of the typhoon is still being assessed.

Additionally, a new tropical storm, Typhoon 13, has formed and is expected to approach Okinawa, intensifying as it moves northward. The Japan Meteorological Agency has urged residents to stay alert for updates on this developing situation. And now for the weather. Today in Tokyo, it's warm with a high of 32 degrees Celsius and a chance of patchy rain, especially in the afternoon.
