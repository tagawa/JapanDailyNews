Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on October 23rd, 2023. Today marks the 19th anniversary of the Niigata earthquake, which claimed the lives of 68 people. The cities of Nagaoka and Ojiya in Niigata Prefecture, where significant damage occurred, are now facing challenges such as population decline and aging. These issues raise concerns about the long-term sustainability of the local communities.

In Osaka, a special exhibition was held on the 22nd, where individuals who create skeletal specimens of living organisms brought their unique specimens for display. This event provided an opportunity for visitors to appreciate the intricacies of skeletal structures and learn more about various species.

Moving on to other news, the investigation into the case of the abandoned body of a high school girl in Tochigi Prefecture has revealed that the suspect rented a car in Utsunomiya City. The police have been tracking the suspect's movements, as they have been found to have traveled to different locations, including Tokyo.

In the entertainment industry, singer-songwriter Monta Yoshinori, known for his hit songs like 'Dancing All Night' and his work with the group 'Monta & Brothers,' passed away at the age of 72 due to aortic dissection.

Turning to nature, the lack of acorns on beech trees in Iwate Prefecture has become a cause for concern. Acorns are a primary food source for bears, and the scarcity of acorns may lead bears to seek food in residential areas. Local authorities are urging caution and vigilance.

Shifting our focus to the field of caregiving, discussions on the revision of caregiving fees for the next fiscal year have commenced at the expert committee of the Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare. With the ongoing shortage of caregivers, the revision aims to address the challenges of securing sufficient caregiving personnel.

Lastly, an update on transportation news. The Toei Oedo Line in Tokyo, which experienced a smoke incident caused by a rubber-like substance on the tracks, has resumed normal operations since the early hours of the 23rd, following the completion of repair work. Trains are running as scheduled on the entire line.

That's all for today's news. Thank you for tuning in to Japan Daily News. Stay informed and have a great day! And now for the weather. Today in Tokyo, the weather will be partly cloudy with a high of 22°C and a low of 16°C.  Visit JapanDailyNews.com for the news, yen exchange rates, and a daily Japanese proverb.
