Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on May 18th, 2023. The G7 summit in Hiroshima is set to begin tomorrow, and before the start of the summit, survivors of the atomic bombing and NGOs held a press conference in Hiroshima city to call on world leaders to understand the reality of the bombing and show a path toward nuclear abolition. Meanwhile, Japan is experiencing extreme heat in the eastern and northern regions, with some areas reaching dangerous levels. The Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare is urging people to take precautions against heatstroke, such as staying hydrated. In other news, the Ministry is also warning of a domestic outbreak of the highly contagious measles virus, urging those with symptoms to follow medical instructions and encouraging those who have not been vaccinated to consider doing so. On the international front, the US Department of Justice has announced the indictment of a Russian suspect for using ransomware to conduct cyber attacks, with Japan's cyber special investigation unit cooperating in the investigation. Additionally, the World Meteorological Organization has released a report stating that there is a 66% chance that the annual average temperature will be over 1.5 degrees higher than before the Industrial Revolution in the next five years. In other news, a group of volunteers have returned a Japanese macaque, a national natural monument, to the Yatsugatake Mountains in Nagano Prefecture after raising it in a villa at the foot of the mountain. Lastly, a comment made by a member of the Japan Innovation Party regarding a Sri Lankan woman who died in an immigration detention center in Nagoya two years ago has sparked controversy, with the woman's family strongly protesting the inaccurate statement. And now for the weather. Today in Tokyo, it will be mostly sunny with a high of 23°C (73°F) and a low of 22°C (71°F).  And that's all for today's news. Thanks for listening to Japan Daily News.
