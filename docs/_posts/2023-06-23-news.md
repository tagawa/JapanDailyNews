Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on June 23rd, 2023. In today's news, train service on the Keikyu Line between Yokohama and Kamiooka stations has resumed after being temporarily suspended due to a personnal accident at Idogaya station. The suspension lasted until around 7:30 a.m. The Keikyu Line was also affected by another accident at Idogaya station, causing the suspension of train service between Yokohama and Kamiooka stations. The resumption of service was expected around 7:30 a.m.

Moving on to another news story, a report has been released regarding a tragic case of bullying in Kawaguchi, Saitama. A 15-year-old male student who had reported being bullied took his own life, leaving behind a note criticizing the school and the board of education. The report points out that the school and the board of education failed to address the bullying issue and the subsequent secondary trauma suffered by the student, which ultimately led to his suicide.

Next, we turn to Okinawa, where the island commemorates the 78th anniversary of the Battle of Okinawa, the last major battle of World War II. The Peace Memorial Park in Itoman City has been the site of early morning prayers and offerings by bereaved families. With less than 10% of the population having experienced the war firsthand, the challenge lies in how the memories of the Battle of Okinawa will be passed on to future generations.

Shifting gears, Emperor and Empress of Japan have concluded their official visit to Indonesia, marking their first goodwill visit since ascending to the throne. They will return to Japan today after a seven-day visit.

In other news, a tragic incident unfolded in Kobe, where the lifeless body of a 6-year-old boy was found in a nearby grassy area. Four family members, including the boy's mother, have been arrested on suspicion of confining and assaulting the boy's grandmother at their residence. The police are investigating any possible connection between the boy's death and the alleged abuse.

Moving on, the results of DNA analysis on the remains of those who perished in the Battle of Okinawa have revealed that 46 out of the examined remains belong to females, including one child. Experts suggest that these remains likely belong to local residents, providing valuable insights into the extent of civilian involvement in the Battle of Okinawa.

Lastly, in the case of the shooting incident involving former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, the pre-trial procedure for the accused, Tohru Yamagami, has been suspended due to the delivery of a suspicious cardboard box to the court. Yamagami's defense team has stated that he is considering whether or not to attend the future proceedings.
