Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on May 28th, 2024. In today's news, severe rainfall is expected in southern Kyushu, Amami, Shikoku, and Tokai due to the influence of a front and low-pressure system. The Japan Meteorological Agency is urging caution for landslides, flooding in low-lying areas, and river flooding. Moving on to our next story, the city of Omura in Nagasaki Prefecture has issued a resident certificate with the notation 'husband (not registered)' to a same-sex couple. This is considered an exceptional measure in Japan where same-sex marriage is not yet recognized. The mayor of Omura is planning to provide a detailed explanation of the situation. Now, let's turn our attention to Tokyo, where a murder case has shocked the community. A 25-year-old woman was fatally stabbed in a tower apartment complex in Shinjuku. The suspect, who has been arrested, stated that he saw the victim criticizing herself during a live stream and wanted to meet and talk with her. In another tragic incident, an accident in the Kobe Motomachi shopping street has claimed three lives and left others injured. The driver of the car involved, an 87-year-old man, had alcohol levels exceeding the legal limit. The police are investigating the details of the accident. Shifting gears, we have some concerning statistics regarding work-related accidents. The number of fatalities and injuries from work-related accidents has increased for the third consecutive year, reaching over 135,000 people last year. The Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare is calling on companies to implement measures to prevent accidents, particularly among elderly workers. Moving on to national defense news, a former commander of the Maritime Self-Defense Force, Yoji Koda, stated that based on the footage he has seen, he believes it is reasonable to conclude that the missile launch was a failure due to the inability to achieve stable flight. Lastly, the Chief Cabinet Secretary announced in a press conference that North Korea attempted to launch a ballistic missile using satellite technology from the Tongchang-ri area in northwestern North Korea. However, the missile disappeared over the Yellow Sea, and it is estimated that no object was successfully launched into space. That's all for today's news. Stay tuned for more updates from Japan Daily News. And now for the weather. The weather in Tokyo today is sunny with a high of 25 degrees Celsius.
