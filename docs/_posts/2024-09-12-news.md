Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on September 12th, 2024. In Okinawa, Governor Tamaki has voiced his concerns directly to US officials regarding a series of sexual assault incidents involving American military personnel. During his visit to the United States, he met with representatives from both the State Department and the Defense Department to discuss the issue, highlighting the local community's growing unease over these incidents.

In a move to bolster the workforce in the caregiving sector, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare has announced a new system for the national certification exam for care workers. This initiative will allow candidates to take the exam in three separate parts, with those passing a section being exempt from retaking it for the next two years. This change aims to make it easier for individuals working in the field to obtain their certification.

Turning to legal matters, the trial of a 28-year-old woman accused of murdering her wealthy ex-husband, known as the 'Don Juan of Kishu,' is set to begin today at the Wakayama District Court. The defense is expected to plead not guilty, and the court proceedings will focus on uncovering the details surrounding the case.

In healthcare news, a recent survey has revealed that nine university hospitals across Japan are reconsidering their policies on sending doctors to other medical institutions. This change comes in light of the ongoing reforms aimed at improving working conditions for medical professionals, which began in April of this year.

In urban development, a meeting is scheduled for September 28th to discuss a revised plan for the redevelopment of Meiji Jingu Gaien in Tokyo, particularly focusing on the preservation of trees in the area. This comes as part of ongoing discussions about balancing development with environmental concerns.

In a concerning incident in Aichi Prefecture, police have admitted to mistakenly arresting a man who was not driving during a traffic accident. The individual was wrongly detained on suspicion of causing injury through negligent driving, and the deputy chief of police has expressed regret over the error.

Lastly, in a high-profile case from 11 years ago, the Kyoto District Court has decided that the trial of a yakuza member accused of murdering the president of the Gyoza no Ohsho chain will proceed without a jury. The court has opted for a judge-only trial, which will focus on the evidence presented by the prosecution. And now for the weather. Today in Tokyo, expect a warm day with a high of 32 degrees Celsius and a low of 28 degrees, sunny skies in the morning, and some rain later in the day.
