Welcome to Japan Daily News for May 5th, 2023. Here are today's headlines:

In a study by the Japanese Pediatric Society, it was found that about 4% of children who had contracted COVID-19 still had symptoms such as fever and coughing one month later. The study analyzed data from medical institutions across the country and the society is urging caution as children can also experience long-lasting symptoms.

A forest fire broke out in the popular tourist destination of Kirigamine Kogen in Suwa, Nagano on May 4th, leading to evacuation orders for over 180 people in nearby vacation homes. Nagano prefecture has requested disaster dispatch from the Self-Defense Forces and is working to strengthen firefighting efforts, including using helicopters to spray water.

On Children's Day, a survey conducted by the Japan Foundation found that 40% of children and young people surveyed requested free education up to university level from the government. However, 60% of respondents said they had never heard of the "Basic Law on Children," which outlines the respect for children's opinions, highlighting the need for better awareness of laws related to children.

The World Health Organization (WHO) held a committee meeting on May 4th to discuss whether to lift the "Public Health Emergency of International Concern" declaration for COVID-19. The decision will be announced soon by the WHO's Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, and his judgement is eagerly awaited.

In Kushiro-cho, Hokkaido, a woman was found dead in her home after someone reported a stabbing incident on May 4th. The person who made the report was found injured elsewhere, and the police are waiting for their recovery to hear their account of the events leading up to the woman's death.

In Suzuka, Mie, a woman was found dead in her apartment on May 3rd, and the police are investigating it as a robbery and murder case as the victim was found with stab wounds and her belongings were missing.

According to estimates by the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications, the number of children under 15 in Japan has decreased for the 42nd consecutive year, with the current number being 14.35 million.

In a certified children's facility in Kuwana, Mie, there have been reports of inappropriate childcare practices, including forcing children to eat lunch for long periods and causing them to have accidents. The city is conducting a detailed investigation into the matter. And that's all for today's news. Thanks for listening to Japan Daily News.
