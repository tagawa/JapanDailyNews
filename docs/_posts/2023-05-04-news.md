Welcome to Japan Daily News on May 4th. Let's start with the stock market news. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell over 200 points in response to the Federal Reserve Board's announcement of an interest rate hike. This news may have an impact on the global economy in the coming days.

Moving on to a tragic incident in Mie Prefecture, where a woman was found dead with multiple cuts on her neck under the stairs of an apartment building. The police are investigating the case as both an accident and a crime. We hope they can find out what happened and bring justice to the victim.

On a positive note, the Japanese government is taking steps to protect biodiversity by designating forests owned by companies and universities as conservation areas. This is a significant move towards achieving the goal of conserving over 30% of land and sea areas to protect various species.

In other news, the Crown Prince and Princess of Japan are visiting the UK to attend the coronation ceremony of King Charles. It is a significant event, and we hope their visit will strengthen the relationship between Japan and the UK.

Unfortunately, there was an incident of robbery and assault at a massage parlor in Tokyo's Ikebukuro district. The suspect threatened a female employee with a knife and fled with cash. The police are investigating the case and trying to apprehend the perpetrator.

In Shizuoka, during a J3 soccer match, the fence of the stadium broke, and more than ten supporters fell onto the ground. One woman was seriously injured, and the police are investigating the cause of the accident.

Finally, a 56-year-old man is missing while hiking from Nara to Wakayama prefectures, and the police and firefighters are searching for him. We hope he is found safe and sound soon.
