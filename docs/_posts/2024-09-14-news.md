Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on September 14th, 2024. In today's news, we begin with a serious weather alert as Typhoon No. 13 is expected to make its closest approach to the Amami region of Kagoshima Prefecture tonight. The Japan Meteorological Agency has warned residents to be on high alert for severe winds and high waves, as the typhoon brings with it a risk of dangerous conditions. Authorities are urging people in the Amami and southwestern islands to prepare for potential disasters, including landslides and flooding.

Switching gears to a troubling incident in Tokyo, a 62-year-old employee of an NHK-related organization has been arrested after allegedly assaulting a station staff member at JR Shibuya Station. Reports indicate that the individual was likely intoxicated at the time of the incident, leading to the confrontation.

In international news, the United Nations has reported that over four million people in West and Central Africa have been affected by severe flooding this year, particularly in countries like Nigeria and Chad. The UN is calling for urgent assistance to support those who have lost their homes due to the devastating floods.

On a more positive note, the Japanese government has announced a new system to streamline immigration and customs procedures for foreign travelers. This system will be implemented at three major airports—Haneda, Narita, and Kansai—by the end of this fiscal year, aiming to expedite the arrival process for visitors.

Meanwhile, in Vietnam, the aftermath of Typhoon No. 11 continues to be felt one week after it struck the country. The storm has resulted in over 250 confirmed deaths due to landslides and flooding, with the Vietnamese government declaring it the most severe disaster in the last 60 years.

Lastly, in Chiba Prefecture, three large dogs, including Dobermans and Shepherds, that had gone missing from a vehicle dismantling facility have been found safe. Police had been actively searching for the dogs, and fortunately, they were located without any reported injuries.

That's all for today's news roundup. And now for the weather. Today in Tokyo, it's sunny with a high of 32 degrees Celsius and a low of 28 degrees, and there will be plenty of sunshine throughout the day.  Visit JapanDailyNews.com for the news, yen exchange rates, and a daily Japanese proverb.
