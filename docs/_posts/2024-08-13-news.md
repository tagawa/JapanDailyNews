Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on August 13th, 2024. In our first news story, Narita Airport temporarily closed one of its runways due to a cargo plane experiencing technical issues. The plane had to make an emergency landing and remained on the runway, causing the closure. However, after the cargo plane was moved and the runway inspected, operations resumed after 8 am.

Moving on to our second story, Typhoon 5 has transformed into a tropical depression, but the effects are still being felt in the Tohoku region. Record-breaking heavy rains have caused flooding and landslides in Iwate Prefecture. Residents on the Pacific side of Tohoku need to remain cautious of further landslides, flooding in low-lying areas, and rising river levels.

Next, we turn to the weather forecast. Today, widespread areas in the Tokai, Kinki, and Kyushu regions are expected to experience dangerous heat. Please continue to take precautions against heatstroke.

In other news, Typhoon 7 has formed in the southern waters of Japan and is expected to come closest to the Ogasawara Islands in Tokyo from the evening of the 14th. There is a possibility that it will approach the Izu Islands and eastern Japan after the 15th. Stay updated with the latest information.

And now, a video forecast by meteorologist Yumi Fuchioka. She explains that although Typhoon 5 has weakened into a tropical depression, we still need to remain vigilant against landslides, rising river levels, flooding in low-lying areas, and strong winds. In addition, heavy rain is expected to continue in the Japan Sea side of Tohoku and Hokkaido. Please stay away from cliffs, rivers, and mountain streams. That's all for today's weather update.

In tragic news, three people have died in a car accident on the Tottori Expressway. A passenger car collided with two trucks inside a tunnel in Tottori City.

Lastly, we have an update on the construction of the seawall at the Tokai Daini Nuclear Power Plant in Ibaraki Prefecture. The operator, Japan Atomic Power Company, has informed the Nuclear Regulation Authority that they plan to reinforce the existing foundation of the seawall instead of rebuilding it. This decision is due to the discovery of defects in the foundation. The completion date of the construction, originally scheduled for September, is expected to be delayed.

That concludes today's news from Japan Daily News. Thank you for listening. And now for the weather. Today in Tokyo, the weather will be partly cloudy with a chance of rain. The average temperature will be 30°C.  Visit JapanDailyNews.com for the news, yen exchange rates, and a daily Japanese proverb.
