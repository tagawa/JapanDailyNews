Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on August 13th, 2024. In our first news story, Narita Airport has reopened one of its runways after a temporary closure. Earlier this morning, a cargo plane experienced technical issues and had to make an emergency landing, causing one of the runways, Runway A, to be closed. However, after the cargo plane was moved and the runway was inspected, operations resumed after 8 am. Moving on to our next story, Typhoon 5 has transformed into a tropical depression, but the effects are still being felt in Tohoku. In Iwate Prefecture, record-breaking heavy rain has caused flooding and landslides. Although the typhoon has weakened, caution is still advised for potential landslides, flooding in low-lying areas, and rising river levels. Please stay updated with the latest information and take necessary precautions. And that's it for today's news from Japan Daily News. Thank you for listening. And now for the weather. Today in Tokyo, the weather will be partly cloudy with a high of 34°C and a low of 28°C. There is a 87% chance of rain.
