Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on January 30th, 2024. In today's news, a 61-year-old company employee has been arrested in Aichi Prefecture on suspicion of arson and the murder of three people. The suspect is believed to have set fire to a large amount of clothing that was piled up on the first floor of an apartment building. The victims were reportedly acquainted with the suspect, and the police are investigating the details of the incident.

Moving on to our next story, the Yamagata Prefecture is finalizing plans to subsidize the cost of egg freezing for healthy women. This initiative aims to support individuals who are struggling to balance pregnancy timing with their career. The subsidy will help cover the expenses of preserving eggs for future use.

In other news, publishers and organizations in Japan have decided to expand their distribution of book and magazine publishing information to independent bookstores. This move comes as independent bookstores, which offer unique book selections, continue to open amid the decline of traditional bookstores.

In Ishikawa Prefecture, where seismic activity remains high, residents are urged to remain cautious of potential landslides. Although the frequency of earthquakes has gradually decreased in the Noto region and its surrounding areas, the seismic activity is still active. Additionally, the higher-than-average temperatures in the affected areas may cause the snow to melt, increasing the risk of landslides.

Due to the recent earthquakes, transportation in Ishikawa Prefecture has been impacted. Highways, railways, buses, and air travel may experience delays or disruptions. Travelers are advised to check for updates and plan their journeys accordingly.

Lastly, eight Japanese individuals are expected to be arrested today for their alleged involvement in a specialized fraud case in the Philippines. Four years ago, these individuals were detained by local authorities in northern Philippines. The group is suspected of making fraudulent phone calls in Japan, targeting elderly individuals and deceiving them into sending money. The Kanagawa Prefectural Police Headquarters plans to bring the suspects back to Japan for further investigation and to uncover the full extent of their activities. And now for the weather. The weather in Tokyo today will be mostly overcast with a high of 11°C and a low of 7°C. There is a slight chance of rain, but overall it will be a cool day.
