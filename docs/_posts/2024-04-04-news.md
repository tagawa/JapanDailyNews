Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on April 4th, 2024. In our first news story, train service on the Keio Inokashira Line has resumed. Due to a point failure at Eifukucho Station, trains between Shibuya Station and Fujimigaoka Station were suspended since the first train of the day. However, service was restored on the entire line after 5:50 am. Moving on to our next story, a graduate school has been established at Yamanashi Prefectural University to cultivate specialized professionals in handling child abuse. The opening ceremony of the research department was held recently. Now, let's turn our attention back to the Keio Inokashira Line. Unfortunately, train service between Shibuya and Fujimigaoka is currently suspended in both directions. The delay is due to nighttime work at Eifukucho Station, which is running behind schedule. The resumption of service is yet to be determined. Shifting gears, we have news from Taiwan. A powerful earthquake struck off the eastern coast, resulting in 9 fatalities and over 1,000 injuries. The Taiwanese authorities have reported that as of last night, 140 people are trapped due to road blockages caused by landslides. Rescue operations are underway to save those in need. Additionally, in Miyazaki, during a high school soccer team's practice match, lightning struck the field, injuring 16 players, 2 of whom are in critical condition. The incident is currently being investigated by the police. Turning back to Taiwan, social media platforms are being flooded with misinformation and fake news related to the recent earthquake. Videos from past disasters, such as the Noto Peninsula earthquake, are being falsely shared as footage from this earthquake. Some individuals are even using these false posts for profit. Please exercise caution and refrain from spreading such information. Lastly, following the earthquake near Taiwan, a temporary tsunami warning was issued for the Miyako and Yaeyama regions of Okinawa. The Japan Meteorological Agency has warned of the possibility of similar-sized earthquakes occurring in the next week, with the potential for accompanying tsunamis. It is advised to remain vigilant. In Okinawa, 4 people sustained minor injuries due to falls while evacuating. That's all for today's news. Thank you for listening to Japan Daily News. And now for the weather. The weather in Tokyo today is cloudy with a chance of rain. The average temperature is 14 degrees Celsius.  Visit JapanDailyNews.com for the news, yen exchange rates, and a daily Japanese proverb.
