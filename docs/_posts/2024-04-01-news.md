Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on April 1st, 2024. In today's news, we begin with an update on the Noto Peninsula Earthquake. It has been three months since the earthquake struck, and while the number of aftershocks has decreased, the government's earthquake research committee is urging continued vigilance as there is still a possibility of strong tremors and tsunamis.

Moving on to our next story, starting from April 1st, time limit regulations for overtime work have been implemented in the transport, construction, and medical industries. While this is expected to address the issue of long working hours, concerns have been raised about the impact on logistics and regional healthcare, highlighting the challenges of the so-called '2024 problem'.

In other news, the Volcano Investigation and Research Promotion Headquarters will be established today. This organization will centrally coordinate the observation and research of volcanoes nationwide, playing a key role in addressing the challenges related to volcanic disaster prevention.

Shifting our focus back to the Noto Peninsula Earthquake, footage has emerged from Sado, Niigata, showing a tsunami overtopping the seawall just 15 minutes after the earthquake. Experts emphasize the importance of this footage in understanding the nature of the relatively rare tsunamis that occurred during this earthquake.

As we mark three months since the Noto Peninsula Earthquake, the focus now turns to the challenges of supporting the rebuilding of lives in Ishikawa Prefecture. With over 8,000 people still living in evacuation centers and ongoing water shortages, the affected residents face a difficult living environment. The priority is to provide support for housing and other aspects of their lives to facilitate the process of recovery.

Similarly, in Toyama, three months after the Noto Peninsula Earthquake, the recovery of the more than 16,000 houses affected by liquefaction remains a challenge. Restoring the liquefied ground and rebuilding homes for those affected are crucial tasks in the ongoing recovery efforts.

Lastly, the iconic moving 'Gundam' in Yokohama Port has concluded its over three-year-long public exhibition. To commemorate this event, a special celebration was held last night, bringing together fans from Japan and around the world. And now for the weather. Today in Tokyo, the weather will be mostly overcast with a chance of light rain showers. The average temperature will be around 14 degrees Celsius.
