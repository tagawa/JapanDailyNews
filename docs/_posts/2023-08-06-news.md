### Transcript

Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on August 6th, 2023. Today, Hiroshima marks the 78th anniversary of the atomic bombing that devastated the city. Despite hosting the G7 Summit in May, there were no concrete steps towards nuclear disarmament, according to some survivors. Hiroshima will use this day to remember the victims and call for a world without nuclear weapons.

In other news, Typhoon 6 has caused widespread damage and disruption in Okinawa and Kagoshima prefectures. Over 30,000 households in Okinawa are experiencing power outages, and emergency water supply has been provided in Naha City.

Moving on, former Liberal Democratic Party member Mari Akimoto, who left the party after being investigated for bribery related to offshore wind power, has been found to have managed the bank account of a horse owner's association and purchased racehorses on her own. The association's president provided approximately 30 million yen, and the Tokyo District Public Prosecutors Office is investigating whether it was a bribe to Akimoto personally.

Meanwhile, Typhoon 6 continues to pose a serious threat to the Okinawa mainland. A linear rain band, consisting of developed cumulonimbus clouds, has formed, increasing the risk of landslides, flooding, and other life-threatening disasters. Residents are urged to remain vigilant and take precautions against landslides, river flooding, strong winds, and high waves.

Lastly, heavy rain and strong winds from Typhoon 6 have also affected Hokkaido. Due to the rain-river flooding, the town of Numata has issued evacuation orders for 5 households in the Kyosei Nakajima area. A community center has been designated as an evacuation shelter.
