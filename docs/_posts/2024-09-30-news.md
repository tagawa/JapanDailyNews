Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on September 30th, 2024. Today, we begin with the weather as Typhoon No. 17 is expected to approach the Ogasawara Islands by early afternoon, bringing with it the potential for heavy rain and thunderstorms. The Japan Meteorological Agency has issued warnings for landslides and high waves, urging residents to stay alert and take necessary precautions. Meanwhile, Typhoon No. 18 is also anticipated to affect the Okinawa main island, adding to the weather concerns in the region.

In other news, a violent robbery occurred in Kokubunji, Tokyo, where multiple men broke into a residence early this morning. They assaulted a woman in her sixties, binding her with tape before fleeing the scene. The Tokyo Metropolitan Police are currently investigating this incident as a robbery.

In Okinawa, a hit-and-run incident took place on the night of September 29th, when a car sped into a crowded street during a local festival, hitting four individuals, including middle school students. Authorities are actively searching for the driver involved in this incident.

Turning to postal services, starting October 1st, Japan Post will implement a nationwide increase in postal rates. This decision comes as the postal business continues to face losses due to declining usage and rising logistics costs. In response, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications is considering a review of the system, which may include allowing for more flexible rate hikes in the future.

In a troubling case from Fukui, a 60-year-old woman has been arrested on suspicion of murdering her 84-year-old mother. The incident occurred at their home, where it is reported that the daughter strangled her mother. Authorities are continuing their investigation into the circumstances surrounding this tragic event.

Lastly, following a personal injury incident at Hakata South Station in Fukuoka, the Sanyo Shinkansen has resumed operations after a temporary halt. The service interruption affected the line between Okayama and Hakata but has now returned to normal. And now for the weather. Today in Tokyo, it will be cloudy with a high of 24 degrees Celsius and a low of 21 degrees Celsius, and there is a chance of light drizzle.
