Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on July 27th, 2023. In today's news, a dangerous heatwave is expected in the Kyushu and Kinki regions, with temperatures reaching up to 39 degrees Celsius. It is advised to take precautions against heatstroke by using air conditioning appropriately and staying hydrated.

Moving on to our next story, a new system is set to begin where prisons and juvenile detention centers will listen to the emotions of crime victims and convey them to the offenders. A training workshop was held in Tokyo for staff members from facilities across the country.

In other news, amidst the scorching heat, the Shuzenji hot spring town in Izu City, Shizuoka Prefecture, has introduced a new attraction called 'Ashimizu,' which allows visitors to cool their feet in water. This unique foot bath has become popular among tourists.

Meanwhile, the Shikoku Aquarium in Uchinomi, Kagawa Prefecture, is currently hosting an exhibition featuring small creatures that are in the midst of growing. Visitors have the opportunity to see fish and other tiny creatures that are not usually visible.

In Nagasaki City, children on summer vacation have taken on the challenge of creating a 'Penguin Encyclopedia' at the Nagasaki Penguin Aquarium. The project aims to educate children about penguins and their habitats.

Tragically, in Suita City, Osaka, a mother and her two children fell from an apartment building on the 26th. The 39-year-old mother and her 3-year-old son lost their lives in the incident. The police suspect that the mother pushed her two children before jumping herself, and further investigations are underway.

Lastly, discussions on raising the minimum wage for this fiscal year took place in the Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare's advisory council on the 26th. However, there is still a gap between labor and management regarding the amount of the increase. Another meeting will be held on the 28th in an attempt to reach a consensus. And now for the weather.
