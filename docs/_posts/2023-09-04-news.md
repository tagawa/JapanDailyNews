Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on September 4th, 2023. In the early hours of September 4th, a collision between two large trucks occurred on National Route 16 in Kashiwa, Chiba. The driver of one of the trucks was critically injured and transported to the hospital in an unconscious state. As a result, the area near the accident site has been closed to traffic since 7 a.m.The warm and humid air flowing into the Kanto, Koshin, and Tohoku regions has brought rain, with some areas experiencing intensifying showers. Late in the evening on September 4th in the Kanto and Koshin regions, and continuing into September 5th in Tohoku, the atmospheric conditions are expected to become unstable, leading to the possibility of severe thunderstorms in localized areas. It is important to be cautious of potential landslides, flooding in low-lying areas, lightning strikes, and gusty winds.On September 4th, the Supreme Court is expected to deliver a verdict on the ongoing legal battle concerning the construction at Henoko in Okinawa, which has been a major focus of the plan to relocate the U.S. military's Futenma Air Station. The judgment will determine whether the national government's directive to the prefectural government, which refused to approve the improvement work on the soft ground in Henoko, was illegal. It is anticipated that the prefectural government's opposition to the relocation will be confirmed by the court's decision.Due to a signal malfunction at Uwafuoka Station in Fujimino, Saitama, the suspension of train services on the Tobu Tojo Line has expanded.
