### Transcript

Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on May 27th, 2023. Researchers at the University of Tokyo have discovered a new mechanism behind implantation failure during infertility treatments. The finding could lead to the development of new treatments. The Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare has decided to provide compensation to 14 people who died after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine due to the possibility of a causal relationship. The ministry has changed the name of the infectious disease 'monkeypox' to 'emmpox' as it continues to spread in Japan. Typhoon No. 2 is expected to approach Okinawa from Tuesday, May 30th, and may also affect the mainland of Japan. A man has died in a car fire at the Chikugo Police Station in Fukuoka Prefecture, and the police are investigating the incident. The suspect in the Nagano shooting had an interest in guns and was accustomed to handling them as part of his bird and animal damage prevention measures. The Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare has postponed the review of the long-term care insurance system until the end of the year. The Metropolitan Expressway No. 1 Haneda Line has been closed in some sections since this morning due to bridge replacement work, causing heavy traffic in the surrounding areas. And now for the weather. Today in Tokyo, it will be partly cloudy with a high of 21°C (70°F) and a low of 20°C (67°F). There is no chance of rain, and the UV index is 6.  And that's all for today's news. Thanks for listening to Japan Daily News.
