Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on October 7th, 2024. In Okinawa, a rally was held in Naha on October 6th, marking one year since the outbreak of conflict in Gaza between the Israeli military and Hamas. Citizens and international students gathered to call for an immediate ceasefire, expressing solidarity with those affected by the ongoing violence.

Meanwhile, Japan is witnessing a surge in the construction of logistics facilities, driven by the expansion of online shopping. Local governments are exploring ways to repurpose these large buildings as evacuation centers for residents in case of emergencies, highlighting a proactive approach to community safety.

In Tokyo, a tragic incident occurred in Shinjuku where an 89-year-old woman was found deceased in her apartment late on the night of October 6th. The woman was discovered with a towel covering her face, and authorities are concerned for her husband, who has been unreachable. Police are investigating the situation, suspecting that he may hold crucial information.

In Hiroshima, the aftermath of a road collapse last month has led to serious concerns. During underground excavation work, a section of road caved in, causing nearby buildings to tilt. The city and the contractor have deemed nine structures as hazardous, prompting safety measures to be put in place.

In Kumamoto, local firefighters conducted their first rescue training using a large device that simulates the conditions of collapsed buildings. This initiative was prompted by the delayed response times observed during the Noto Peninsula earthquake, aiming to equip firefighters with essential rescue skills for future emergencies.

Lastly, in Okayama, children participated in a unique eating contest at the Hiruzensan Highlands, where they competed to see how much 'jingisukan', a local specialty dish, they could consume within a time limit. This event not only showcased local cuisine but also brought the community together in a fun and engaging manner. And now for the weather. Today in Tokyo, expect a warm day with a high of 28 degrees Celsius, mostly cloudy skies, and a chance of rain later.
