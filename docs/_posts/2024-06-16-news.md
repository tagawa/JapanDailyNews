Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on June 16th, 2024. In today's news, the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology has announced that teacher recruitment exams will be moved up in over 10 municipalities, as the ratio of applicants to open positions in public schools has reached an all-time low. The exams will be held on June 16th, which has been designated as the 'standard day' for the exams. In other news, Narita Airport has reported a profit for the first time in 4 years. The recovery of air travel demand, driven by the easing of COVID-19 border controls and the weakening of the yen, has contributed to this positive result.

Moving on, today's weather forecast predicts another day of scorching heat across the country. Please take necessary precautions and stay hydrated to avoid heatstroke. Additionally, a wide area spanning from northern to western Japan is expected to experience unstable atmospheric conditions on the 17th, with the possibility of thunderstorms, gusty winds, and heavy localized rainfall. Please exercise caution and be aware of the potential risks.

In commemoration of the 60th anniversary of the Niigata earthquake, which is considered a significant event that drew attention to liquefaction, a panel discussion is being held in Niigata City to share personal experiences and discuss the importance of liquefaction countermeasures. The earthquake occurred on June 16th, 1964, and highlighted the need for measures against liquefaction. The city of Niigata is actively working to pass down the knowledge gained from this experience.

In Tokyo, 18 people were rushed to the hospital on the 15th with suspected heatstroke. Among them, one person in their 70s is in critical condition, while seven individuals in their 50s and 80s are in a moderate condition. The remaining ten people are experiencing mild symptoms. The Tokyo Fire Department urges everyone to stay hydrated and take preventive measures against heatstroke, such as drinking plenty of fluids before feeling thirsty.

Lastly, in a tragic incident, an 18-year-old male university student is in critical condition after drowning in the Fukuchi River in Nakatsugawa City, Gifu Prefecture. The student was visiting the river with friends when the accident occurred, and he is currently unconscious and in critical condition. Our thoughts go out to his family and friends during this difficult time.

That's all for today's news. Thank you for listening to Japan Daily News. Stay tuned for more updates. And now for the weather. Today in Tokyo, the weather will be partly cloudy with a high of 27°C and a low of 22°C. There is a 100% chance of rain and a UV index of 9.
