Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on March 7th, 2024. In our first news story, an early morning fire broke out in a residential home in Fuchu, Tokyo, resulting in the hospitalization of an elderly couple. Both individuals were unconscious at the time of their transport to the hospital. Moving on to our next story, in a case involving the murder of a 4-year-old daughter and her 40-year-old sister, it has been revealed that the husband and wife had illegally sold the father's condominium, causing a dispute within the family. The investigation is now looking into the circumstances surrounding the sister's involvement in her father's company's accounting department. In other news, an Osaka-based company that offered a luxury watch 'sharing service' abruptly announced its dissolution. It was discovered that the company had sold some of the watches without receiving rental payments from the customers who had borrowed them, raising suspicions about the true nature of their business operations. Moving on, a resident of Kanazawa City, Mr. Hiroshi Bakazaki, shared his heartfelt story about losing his 90-year-old father, Mr. Youho, in an earthquake. Mr. Bakazaki described his father as a 'stubborn old man' and expressed his enduring grief. Shifting gears, during a baseball exhibition game for the Japanese national team, elementary school students from Rizu and Nanao, which were affected by the Noto Peninsula earthquake, participated in the ceremonial first pitch. A 6th-grade girl from Rizu City threw the ball, symbolizing her gratitude and support for the disaster-stricken areas. Additionally, in Suzu City, Ishikawa Prefecture, which suffered significant damage from the earthquake, concerns are rising about the upcoming rice cultivation season due to the extensive damage to agricultural facilities. Finally, a free consultation event was held in Kaga City, Ishikawa Prefecture, to provide temporary job opportunities, such as part-time work, to those who have been evacuated from their homes due to the earthquake. And now for the weather. Today in Tokyo, the weather will be partly cloudy with a maximum temperature of 10°C and a minimum temperature of 5°C.
