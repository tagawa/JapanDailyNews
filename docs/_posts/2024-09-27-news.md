Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on September 27th, 2024. In weather news, a significant weather system is affecting the Kanto region, Shizuoka, and the Izu Islands. The Japan Meteorological Agency has issued warnings for heavy rain that is expected to continue through tomorrow. Residents are being advised to remain cautious of potential flooding and landslides as developed rain clouds move into the area.

Meanwhile, in Ishikawa Prefecture, search efforts are ongoing for missing persons following record rainfall that led to severe flooding and landslides. Today marks the sixth day since the disaster struck the Noto region, and authorities are working diligently to resolve isolated conditions in three areas that remain difficult to access.

In political news, Hyogo Governor Saito has announced his intention to resign following a vote of no confidence from the prefectural assembly. He plans to step down on September 30 and will seek re-election in a special election expected to take place by mid-November, as he aims to regain the trust of the residents.

In a significant judicial development, Iwao Hakamada has been acquitted after 58 years of wrongful conviction for the murder of four family members in Shizuoka. The court found that three pieces of evidence used against him were fabricated, leading to a harsh critique of the investigative authorities. The focus now shifts to whether the prosecution will appeal this landmark decision.

Additionally, today marks ten years since the eruption of Mount Ontake, which occurred without clear warning signs. The chairman of the Volcanic Eruption Prediction Committee has highlighted advancements in research over the past decade but emphasized that accurate predictions remain challenging. He urges caution for those planning to hike active volcanoes.

Lastly, in corporate news, FM Tokyo has announced the resignation of its president, Osamu Kurozaka, effective October 1. The company cited his inappropriate conduct as the reason for his departure, which has caused internal turmoil. Kurozaka will transition to the role of chairman without executive powers. And now for the weather. Today in Tokyo, expect light rain with temperatures around 25 degrees Celsius and high humidity.
