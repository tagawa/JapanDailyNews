Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on February 2nd, 2024. In today's news, we have two significant stories coming out of Japan.

First, we have transportation disruptions in Ishikawa Prefecture due to an earthquake. The earthquake has affected various modes of transportation, including railways, air travel, buses, and highways. Authorities are assessing the impact on the transportation infrastructure and working to restore normal operations.

Moving on to our second story, a suspect wanted for attempted murder in Nagano three years ago has been arrested. The suspect, a high-ranking member of a designated organized crime group, had been on the run and was found living in an apartment in Sendai City. The apartment was rented under a corporate name, and the police are investigating the suspect's activities during his time in hiding.

Next, we turn our attention to the prevention of disaster-related deaths. It has been a month since the Noto Peninsula earthquake, and measures are being taken to address the issue of 'disaster-related deaths' caused by deteriorating health conditions during evacuation. While efforts are being made to prevent conditions like economy class syndrome and pneumonia in affected areas, experts highlight the need for a diverse range of support from specialists, as cases of deaths due to psychological stress have also been reported.

In order to support businesses in the sake industry affected by the Noto Peninsula earthquake, the National Tax Agency has implemented special measures to simplify the procedures for receiving liquor tax refunds.

Shifting our focus to the evacuation centers, it has been reported that in Ishikawa Prefecture's Nanao City, a designated time has been set aside for residents to enjoy a drink together for one hour before lights out. This initiative aims to provide a small respite for those affected by the earthquake.

In sports news, Japanese soccer player Junya Ito will be leaving the national team participating in the Asian Cup in Qatar. The Japan Football Association has responded cautiously to some reports regarding Ito's situation, taking into consideration the player's physical and mental condition.

Lastly, a major education services company will be launching a new service in March that utilizes generative AI to address students' learning questions in distance education. This move reflects the growing trend of incorporating generative AI in the education industry.

That concludes today's news from Japan Daily News. Thank you for listening. And now for the weather. Today in Tokyo, the weather will be overcast with a chance of patchy rain nearby. The average temperature will be 5 degrees Celsius.  Visit JapanDailyNews.com for the news, yen exchange rates, and a daily Japanese proverb.
