Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on July 2nd, 2024. In today's news, Japan is experiencing continued unstable weather conditions with heavy rain and the risk of landslides in western and eastern regions. The recent rainfall has caused loose ground in some areas, prompting authorities to issue warnings about potential landslides and other hazards. Moving on to Hokkaido, a ferry carrying 140 passengers and crew members ran aground near Tomakomai Port. Fortunately, there were no injuries reported, and there has been no significant water damage or oil spillage. Efforts are underway to refloat the ferry with the assistance of tugboats.

In other news, the city of Hagi in Yamaguchi Prefecture has issued evacuation orders for 684 households and 1,334 people in the Asahi region due to increased risk of disaster. The evacuation order is at alert level 4, urging everyone to evacuate from dangerous areas.

Turning to transportation news, train services on the JR Chuo Line Rapid and Chuo-Sobu Line Local have resumed after being temporarily suspended due to a personal injury incident at Mitaka Station. The services were halted between Tokyo Station and Takao Station, as well as between Mitaka Station and Chiba Station. However, operations have now resumed, providing relief to commuters.

Meanwhile, the aftermath of the aircraft collision incident at Haneda Airport six months ago continues to unfold. The national Transportation Safety Commission has made an unusual request to passengers of the involved aircraft, asking them to provide videos taken during the incident through their respective airlines. The aim is to gain a clearer understanding of the circumstances surrounding the accident.

Lastly, in a case that shook Fukuoka in 2020, the mother of a woman who was murdered at a commercial facility is utilizing a new system to convey her feelings to the perpetrator, who was a minor at the time of the crime. Through prison staff, she expressed her desire for the offender to face the victims and their families' emotions head-on and provide a genuine apology.

That concludes today's news from Japan Daily News. Stay tuned for more updates on the latest happenings in Japan. And now for the weather. Today in Tokyo, the weather will be partly cloudy with a maximum temperature of 30°C and a minimum temperature of 24°C.
