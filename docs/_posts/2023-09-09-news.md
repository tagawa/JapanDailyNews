### Transcript

Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on September 9th, 2023. In today's news, we have two significant stories to cover. First, due to heavy rain caused by Typhoon 13, JR East has suspended planned train services on some conventional lines, including the Uchibo Line. This is because the tracks cannot be inspected under such weather conditions. Moving on to our second story, a 6.8 magnitude earthquake struck the inland region of Morocco. According to the United States Geological Survey (USGS), the earthquake occurred at around 7:11 am Japan time. The epicenter was approximately 18 kilometers deep, and the magnitude was estimated to be 6.8. Now, let's dive deeper into each story.

Starting with the typhoon, Typhoon 13, also known as a tropical depression, has caused unstable atmospheric conditions in the Kanto and Tohoku regions. This has led to the development of rain clouds, resulting in flooding and landslides in various areas of Fukushima, Ibaraki, and Chiba prefectures. The heavy rainfall has caused significant damage, with reports of flooded streets and collapsed slopes. As a precautionary measure, evacuation orders were issued in multiple cities and towns, including parts of Chiba and Ibaraki. However, as the situation improves, some of these evacuation orders have now been lifted. For example, the cities of Ichihara, Kimitsu, and Kisarazu, along with several other municipalities in Chiba, have completely lifted their evacuation orders. Similarly, Mito City in Ibaraki has also lifted its evacuation order and closed all temporary shelters.

Moving on to the earthquake in Morocco, the country experienced a 6.8 magnitude earthquake with its epicenter located in the inland region. The earthquake struck at 7:11 am Japan time and had a depth of approximately 18 kilometers. Although the earthquake was significant in magnitude, there have been no immediate reports of casualties or major damage. The earthquake serves as a reminder of the unpredictable nature of seismic activity and the importance of preparedness.

That concludes our news report for today. Stay tuned for more updates and news from Japan Daily News.   And that's all for today's news. Thanks for listening to Japan Daily News.
