Welcome to Japan Daily News for April 23, 2023. Here are today's news headlines:

The Japan Air Self-Defense Force has sent three transport planes to Djibouti, a neighboring country of Sudan, in preparation for the evacuation of Japanese citizens in Sudan. The Self-Defense Force is currently preparing for the mission, including gathering information. 

A memorial service will be held in Utoro, Shari Town, Hokkaido, to commemorate the first anniversary of the sinking of a sightseeing boat off the coast of the Shiretoko Peninsula. The service will offer prayers for the victims and renew the commitment of local tourism operators to safety.

The removal of contaminated pipes at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, which were contaminated with high levels of radioactive material during the accident, has been delayed due to repeated problems. The difficulty of decommissioning work has been highlighted once again.

A symposium was held to discuss international responses to the novel coronavirus, and a doctor who worked with the World Health Organization (WHO) called for a mechanism to ensure fairness, pointing out that vaccines and treatments did not reach developing countries.

At a symposium held during the Japan Medical Association Annual Meeting, doctors reported on the progress of diagnosis and treatment of rare diseases using "genomic medicine," which examines genes and provides personalized treatment for each patient.

A man believed to be the owner of a ramen shop in Nagata Ward, Kobe City, was found dead with blood flowing from his head and other parts of his body. The police suspect that the man was a member of a violent gang and was shot in the head with a gun. The police are investigating the case as a murder.

Shinichi Aoki, a lieutenant general, has taken over as the commander of the 8th Division, succeeding Yukihiro Sakamoto, who died in a helicopter accident near Miyako Island, Okinawa Prefecture. Aoki has stated that he will do his best to rebuild the division's system.

As the first anniversary of the sinking of a sightseeing boat off the coast of the Shiretoko Peninsula approaches, the Japan Coast Guard and the police have resumed their search for six people who are still missing along the coast of the peninsula during the winter.
