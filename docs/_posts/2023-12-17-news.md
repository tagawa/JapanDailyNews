Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on December 17th, 2023. In today's news, a heavy snowfall warning has been issued for northern and eastern Japan, with strong winds and the possibility of heavy snowfall. The Japan Meteorological Agency is urging caution for potential impacts on transportation, as well as high waves. Moving on to our next story, the former Vice Minister of Justice, Kazunori Kakizawa, denies any intention of bribery during the Tokyo mayoral election in April. The Tokyo District Public Prosecutor's Office questioned Kakizawa about alleged violations of the Public Offices Election Act. According to sources, Kakizawa explained that the financial support provided to municipal council members before and after the election was not intended for bribery. Now, let's turn to Osaka, where it has been two years since the tragic arson attack on a clinic in Kita Ward that claimed the lives of 26 people. Surviving family members and former patients are still grappling with grief and anxiety, highlighting the ongoing need for support. Shifting our focus to Okinawa, a government opinion poll reveals that 78% of respondents expressed interest in the disputed Senkaku Islands. This marks the highest level of interest since the survey began. In other news, a recent estimate suggests that over 410,000 junior high school students in Japan are experiencing tendencies of school refusal, even while physically attending school. An NPO emphasized the importance of early support for these students. Moving on, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare is finalizing adjustments to the long-term care insurance reimbursement rates for the next fiscal year. The planned revision is expected to increase the rates by 1.59%, and when combined with the consolidation of additional payments for improving the treatment of caregiving staff, the overall increase is projected to be around 2.04%. This will help realize better wages for caregiving professionals. Lastly, in Ishikawa Prefecture's Hakusan City, three individuals were injured in separate bear attacks in a residential area. Although the bears have been removed, there is a possibility that another bear is hiding in a nearby garage, prompting authorities to issue a warning. That's all for today's news. Thank you for tuning in to Japan Daily News. And now for the weather. Today in Tokyo, the weather will be sunny with a high of 13°C and a low of 8°C.
