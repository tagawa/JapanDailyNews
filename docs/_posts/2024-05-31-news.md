Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on May 31st, 2024. In today's news, Chiba Prefecture has revealed that 532 villages are at risk of isolation due to earthquakes and heavy rain, following the isolation of many villages in the Noto Peninsula earthquake. The prefecture plans to provide financial assistance to accelerate measures such as stockpiling. Meanwhile, the Japan Meteorological Agency has issued a warning for severe rainfall in southern Kanto and the Izu Islands. The influence of a temperate cyclone that changed from Typhoon 1 and a front may bring heavy rain accompanied by thunderstorms, leading to the possibility of landslides, flooding of low-lying areas, and increased river levels. Moving on to other news, a bear entered a house in Annaka, Gunma, causing serious injuries to a couple in their 70s. The bear later escaped from the house, and the police have issued a warning to nearby residents. In another incident, a shooting occurred in a taxi in Kawaguchi, Saitama. A drug vial was found inside the taxi, raising suspicions of an automatic pistol being used. The police are investigating the possibility of an automatic pistol being used and searching for the whereabouts of the suspect. On the seismic front, an earthquake with a magnitude of 4 was observed in Kumamoto and Kagoshima prefectures, but there is no concern for a tsunami. In the world of shogi, the fourth game of the Eio Tournament, one of the eight major shogi titles, will be held today in Chiba Prefecture. The current title holder, Hifumi Fujii, who holds eight titles at the age of 21, will face off against Shota Ito, a seventh-dan player. Fujii is in a precarious situation with one win and two losses, and all eyes are on whether he can maintain his eight titles. Lastly, a tragic incident occurred during training at the Ground Self-Defense Force's Kitafuji Training Area in Yamanashi Prefecture. A fragment of a hand grenade exploded during training and struck a male soldier in his 20s, resulting in his death. The Self-Defense Force is investigating the detailed circumstances of the incident. And now for the weather. Today in Tokyo, the weather will be mostly cloudy with a chance of rain. The average temperature will be 18 degrees Celsius.
