### Transcript

Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on September 2nd, 2023. In our first news story, the American football team at Nihon University has been suspended indefinitely once again. Following the discovery of marijuana and stimulants in the team's dormitory, a new search was conducted, and several team members voluntarily underwent questioning. As a result, the university announced the indefinite suspension of the team's activities. Moving on to our second story, the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology is considering imposing a fine on the former Unification Church. The ministry has exercised its questioning rights seven times, seeking reports on the organization's management and donations. However, the church has not provided appropriate answers, leading the ministry to consider requesting the court to impose a fine as an administrative penalty. Now let's turn to the weather. Typhoon 11 is expected to approach the Sakishima Islands in Okinawa on the 3rd. Please be cautious of high waves and strong winds. Additionally, Typhoon 12 is forecasted to come closest to the Ogasawara Islands in Tokyo from tonight until the early hours of the 3rd. Pay attention to heavy rain accompanied by high waves and thunder. Shifting gears, the Fair Trade Commission has initiated an investigation into the used car sales company, Big Motor, for allegedly causing disadvantages to subcontractors. It is suspected that Big Motor used its position to force subcontractors to lower their work rates and perform tasks such as weeding around the store. In scientific news, a group of researchers from the RIKEN Institute and others have discovered that a certain type of gut bacteria is involved in the function of insulin, a hormone that lowers blood sugar levels. This finding has drawn attention as it could contribute to the development of new treatments for diabetes. Turning to historical research, a detailed analysis is being conducted on a document that compiles information on companies before and after the Great Kanto Earthquake. The document, which contains information on over 40,000 companies nationwide, has been left unanalyzed in a private credit research company. The company will collaborate with experts to investigate the document, aiming to verify the extensive damage, which accounted for nearly 40% of the country's GNP, and to utilize the findings for future disaster preparedness. Lastly, in local news, a female city council member in Toyohashi, Aichi Prefecture, was not allowed to participate in the lottery to determine the order of general questions during the regular council meeting because she brought her child with her. According to the councilwoman, she had no choice but to bring her child as they were running a fever. That's all for today's news. Thank you for listening to Japan Daily News. And now for the weather. Today in Tokyo, the weather will be partly cloudy with a maximum temperature of 28°C and a minimum temperature of 27°C. There is a 66% chance of rain.  And that's all for today's news. Thanks for listening to Japan Daily News.
