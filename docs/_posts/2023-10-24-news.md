Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on October 24th, 2023. In our first news story, a 23-year-old male university student from Tokyo and a 26-year-old man from Tokyo who went missing while climbing in the Northern Alps have been rescued. The university student was found safe after being missing for six days, while the other man had already made it down the mountain on his own. Moving on to our next story, it has been two months since the release of treated water from the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant into the ocean began. Concerns are growing as China and now Russia have announced restrictions on the import of Japanese seafood in response to the release. This is expected to have a further impact on the fishing industry. Shifting gears, due to a shortage of bus drivers, the largest bus company in Hokkaido has decided to shorten the routes of 12 bus lines in the Sapporo metropolitan area. The buses will no longer travel to the city center and will terminate at subway stations instead. This change is expected to affect approximately a quarter of the company's weekday schedule in the Sapporo metropolitan area. In another news story, a former instructor from the prominent juku (cram school) company, Yotsuya Otsuka, is facing additional charges of secretly filming three more elementary school students. The Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department plans to pursue further legal action against the former instructor, as they believe there may be additional victims. On a lighter note, Emperor Naruhito and Empress Masako attended a kabuki performance at the National Theatre in Tokyo, which will close at the end of October after 57 years of operation due to its aging infrastructure. Lastly, in Saitama, over 150 students and teachers from two elementary schools have reported feeling unwell after participating in a nature experience program and staying overnight at a hotel in Fukushima Prefecture. The Saitama City Health Center is investigating the possibility of a food poisoning outbreak. And finally, a fire broke out in a gymnasium at a high school in Nagoya last night. While the fire is gradually being brought under control, firefighters are still working to extinguish it. Fortunately, there have been no reported injuries or individuals trapped inside. That's all for today's news. Thank you for listening to Japan Daily News. And now for the weather. Today in Tokyo, the weather will be mostly sunny with a high of 22°C and a low of 17°C. There is a 0% chance of rain and a UV index of 5. Enjoy the nice weather!  Visit JapanDailyNews.com for the news, yen exchange rates, and a daily Japanese proverb.
