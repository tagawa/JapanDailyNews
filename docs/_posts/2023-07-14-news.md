Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on July 14th, 2023. In our first news story, train service on the Odakyu Odawara Line has resumed after being suspended due to a person's accident at Tsurukawa Station. The suspension affected the section between Shin-Yurigaoka and Machida, but as of 7:25 a.m., trains are running again.

Moving on to our next story, a tragic discovery was made at a sewage treatment facility in Fujisawa, Kanagawa Prefecture. The body of a baby was found, and the police are investigating it as a case of corpse abandonment. They are working to determine the identity of the baby.

Staying with the topic of train disruptions, the Odakyu Odawara Line experienced another suspension due to a separate incident at Tsurukawa Station. Train service between Shin-Yurigaoka and Machida was temporarily halted around 6 a.m. It is expected to resume around 7:20 a.m.

Turning to the weather, heavy rain and the potential for landslides are a concern in the Hokuriku and Niigata prefectures. Rain clouds have developed primarily along the Japan Sea side, and caution is advised for potential mudslides until the evening of the 14th. Additionally, there is a risk of heavy rain in the Tohoku region from the 15th to the 16th, so it is important to be prepared.

Shifting gears to a court case, the verdict for the defendant involved in the Odakyu Line stabbing incident will be announced today. The defendant is facing charges of attempted murder and other crimes for the indiscriminate attack that injured multiple passengers. The Tokyo District Court's decision in this high-profile case is eagerly awaited.

In maritime news, two ships belonging to the Chinese Coast Guard entered Japanese territorial waters off the Senkaku Islands in response to the movements of a Japanese fishing boat. However, by the evening of the 13th, both ships had left the territorial waters. The Japan Coast Guard continues to monitor the situation to prevent any further incursions.

Switching to flood-related news, all observation points in Kyoto Prefecture have reported water levels below the danger mark. This includes the Kawakamitani River at the Hashizume Bridge observation point. The flood warnings in all observation areas in Kyoto Prefecture have been lifted.

Lastly, in Kyoto's Kyotango City, evacuation orders and information for elderly residents and others have been lifted for seven districts in Mineyama-cho, six districts in Ano-cho, and seven districts in Kumihama-cho. As of 11:40 p.m. on the 13th, all evacuation information in Kyoto Prefecture has been rescinded.
