### Transcript

Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on May 23rd, 2023. A series of earthquakes have hit the Izu Islands, with a magnitude 5.0 earthquake being recorded on the island of Toshima. The Japan Meteorological Agency has warned residents to be cautious of strong earthquakes in the region. Meanwhile, construction machinery manufacturers are turning to advanced technologies such as self-driving and remote operation to combat the growing shortage of workers in the construction industry. In other news, the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department plans to arrest four more members of a group suspected of being involved in a special fraud case based in the Philippines. The group is believed to have given instructions for a series of robberies. The prime minister has announced that he will not consider new tax burdens to fund the government's three-year concentrated effort to combat the declining birth rate. The South Korean government has sent a team of experts to investigate the situation at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant, where plans are underway to release treated water into the ocean. Finally, the amount of money lost to special fraud in Japan last year exceeded 37 billion yen, an increase of more than 30% from the previous year. The National Police Agency plans to strengthen enforcement in cooperation with private companies. And now for the weather. Today in Tokyo, it will be mostly cloudy with a high of 18°C (65°F) and a low of 16°C (61°F). There is a chance of light rain showers throughout the day.  And that's all for today's news. Thanks for listening to Japan Daily News.
