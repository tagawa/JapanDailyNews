Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on November 20th, 2023. In today's news, former member of the House of Representatives, Kiyonari Maekawa, has been convicted of violating the Public Office Election Law. Maekawa was found guilty of calling for votes before the official announcement of the election in the House of Representatives election two years ago. The Supreme Court rejected Maekawa's appeal and his conviction has been finalized.

In another news story, two YouTubers, aged 30, have been arrested for soliciting the violation of the Stimulants Control Law. They posted false information on internet bulletin boards, encouraging someone to bring methamphetamine for the purpose of filming a video of capturing the perpetrator of illegal drugs. The YouTubers, who have been repeatedly posting videos of so-called 'citizen arrests,' are currently under investigation by the Metropolitan Police Department.

Moving on to other news, a Chinese fishing boat capsized off the coast of Kagoshima Prefecture, and five crew members are missing. The search operation by the 10th Regional Coast Guard Headquarters is still ongoing.

In the Tokyo Olympics bid-rigging case, the first trial has taken place. The former head of the advertising giant Hakuhodo and Hakuhodo DY Media Partners, who are accused of engaging in illegal bid-rigging for the operation of the Tokyo Olympics and Paralympics, admitted to the general facts of the case. However, they requested careful consideration regarding whether their actions constituted a violation of the Antimonopoly Act.

The mayor of Setagaya Ward in Tokyo, Nobuto Hosaka, has filed a criminal complaint with the Metropolitan Police Department. He claims that false information about him was spread to residents through automated voice calls before the ward mayor election earlier this year.

In other news, Yamato Holdings, one of Japan's largest delivery companies, has unveiled its new cargo-only aircraft that will begin operation next year. This move aims to address the manpower shortage in the transportation industry.

Lastly, a large-scale volcanic eruption has occurred in Papua New Guinea. The Japan Meteorological Agency is currently investigating the possibility of a tsunami and the impact on Japan. As of 6 p.m., there have been no significant changes in sea levels observed at overseas monitoring points. And now for the weather. Today in Tokyo, the weather will be mostly sunny with a high of 17°C and a low of 12°C.  Visit JapanDailyNews.com for the news, yen exchange rates, and a daily Japanese proverb.
