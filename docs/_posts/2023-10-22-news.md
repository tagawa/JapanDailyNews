Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on October 22nd, 2023. In our top stories today:

First, a tragic accident occurred yesterday evening in Yurihonjo, Akita Prefecture. A compact car and a regular passenger car collided head-on on a national highway, resulting in the death of a couple in their 70s who were traveling in the compact car.

Moving on to politics, two by-elections are taking place today. The first is in the Nagasaki 4th district for the House of Representatives, and the second is in the Tokushima-Kochi constituency for the House of Councillors. Both elections feature a showdown between the ruling and opposition parties, and the results could have an impact on Prime Minister Kishida's administration and the dissolution strategy of the House of Representatives.

Next, an update on a disturbing case in Utsunomiya, Tochigi Prefecture. A 28-year-old suspect has been arrested for abandoning the body of a 15-year-old female high school student in a rental car. The suitcase found in the car was empty, indicating that the suspect had prepared it for the disposal of the victim's body. The police are investigating the circumstances and purpose of the suitcase.

In Fukuoka City, a fatal accident occurred yesterday evening at a railway crossing on the JR Chikuhi Line. A train collided with a car, resulting in the death of the male driver. Two female passengers on the train were also taken to the hospital due to feeling unwell, but fortunately, no injuries were reported among the approximately 500 passengers and crew.

Turning to weather news, the Japan Meteorological Agency has issued a tornado advisory for eastern Toyama Prefecture. Strong gusts, possibly including tornadoes, have been observed, and caution is advised.

Lastly, an alarming incident involving a missing teenager and a popular location-sharing app. The body of a 15-year-old female high school student from Chiba City has been found in a car in Kamiotsuwa, Tochigi Prefecture. A 28-year-old suspect has been arrested in connection with the case, and the police suspect that the victim was strangled to death. In another development, it has been revealed that the location information and chat logs of over 2.3 million users of the popular app 'NauNau' were accessible to external sources. The company has acknowledged the issue, temporarily suspended the app's service starting from yesterday, and plans to conduct an investigation by a third-party organization.
