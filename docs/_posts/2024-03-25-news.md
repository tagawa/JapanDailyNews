Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on March 25th, 2024. In our top stories today, Kobayashi Pharmaceuticals, based in Osaka, has announced that it is suspending the supply of red yeast rice ingredients to approximately 50 companies. This comes after reports of people developing kidney diseases and other illnesses after consuming health food products containing the red yeast rice component. Several companies that received the supply have already announced product recalls.

Moving on to our next story, the Imperial Household Agency has revealed that it will be launching an official Instagram account next month to share information about the activities of the royal family. This marks the first time that the agency will be utilizing social media platforms for communication purposes.

In other news, a recent survey conducted by an industry association has found that around 10% of subcontracting companies in the construction sector have average overtime hours exceeding the new limits set to be implemented from April. The regulation aims to strengthen control over overtime work in the industry.

Shifting gears, the expansion of renewable energy sources in Japan is leading to the need for new transmission networks. To address this, a plan has been finalized to invest over 1.5 trillion yen in establishing a new transmission network connecting regions with high solar and wind power generation, such as Hokkaido and Kyushu, with major consumption areas like Tokyo.

In tragic news, a woman in her 70s was found collapsed on a street in Tokyo's Toshima Ward and was later pronounced dead. The Metropolitan Police Department is treating the incident as a hit-and-run case and is currently investigating the whereabouts of the vehicle involved based on witness testimonies and the scene of the incident.

On a lighter note, the city of Wajima in Ishikawa Prefecture celebrated the blooming of snowflake flowers with an event that attracted residents who are currently living in evacuation shelters. The event brought some joy to those affected by the disaster.

Lastly, in response to the Noto Peninsula earthquake, a tent village has been completed in the city of Nanao in Ishikawa Prefecture. The tent village will serve as an accommodation base for volunteers involved in disaster relief efforts. And now for the weather. Today in Tokyo, the weather will be partly cloudy with a high of 25 degrees Celsius and a low of 18 degrees Celsius.
