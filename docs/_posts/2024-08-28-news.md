Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on August 28th, 2024. Today, we begin with the approaching Typhoon 10, which is currently located off the coast of Amami City in Kagoshima Prefecture. The Japan Meteorological Agency has issued warnings about the potential for maximum wind speeds of up to 70 meters per second, which could lead to severe damage, including the collapse of some residential structures. Special warnings for strong winds, high waves, and storm surges may be issued for Kagoshima Prefecture around noon today. Additionally, heavy rain warnings are also in place for both Kagoshima and Miyazaki Prefectures, prompting officials to urge residents to take necessary precautions before conditions worsen. The effects of the typhoon are expected to extend beyond the immediate area, with heavy rainfall anticipated in western and eastern Japan as well.

In related news, the impact of Typhoon 10 is already being felt in transportation, with planned suspensions of Shinkansen services and air travel disruptions expected from today onward.

Moving to Aichi Prefecture, there has been a serious landslide incident in Gamagori City. A family of five was caught in the landslide late last night, and while one woman in her forties has been rescued and is conscious, search efforts continue for another woman believed to be trapped in the vicinity.

In Akita Prefecture, a tragic fire broke out early this morning, resulting in the complete destruction of three homes. Authorities have discovered two bodies in the aftermath of the fire. A 90-year-old couple who lived in one of the homes has since gone missing, and police are working to confirm their identities while investigating the cause of the blaze.

Lastly, in the realm of agriculture, the newly harvested rice variety 'Hanaechizen' is hitting store shelves in Fukui Prefecture at prices over 30% higher than usual due to a nationwide rice shortage. This price increase is a significant concern for consumers as they navigate the current market conditions. And now for the weather. Today in Tokyo, it will be partly cloudy with a high of 31 degrees Celsius and a low of 27 degrees, and there's a chance of patchy rain later.
