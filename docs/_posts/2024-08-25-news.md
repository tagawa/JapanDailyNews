Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on August 25th, 2024. In Tochigi Prefecture, a 35-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of robbery and injury after an incident at a precious metals and brand goods buying store in Moka City. On August 24th, approximately 1.3 million yen in cash was stolen from a portable safe, and the store manager sustained minor injuries during the robbery. 

Meanwhile, Yamagata Prefecture is facing significant challenges one month after record heavy rainfall caused extensive damage. The torrential rains have resulted in the deaths of three individuals and have affected over 1,900 homes. The agricultural, forestry, and fisheries sectors have also suffered losses exceeding 10 billion yen, raising concerns about the ongoing recovery efforts.

Switching gears to technology, the Children and Families Agency has announced plans to utilize information and communication technology to support children with disabilities. Starting next fiscal year, the agency aims to create an environment that allows for remote support, ensuring that all children can access developmental assistance regardless of their location. They will also evaluate the effectiveness and challenges of this initiative.

In weather news, unstable atmospheric conditions are expected to persist across western and eastern Japan today, with warm and humid air moving into the region. Authorities are advising caution regarding flooding in low-lying areas, as well as rising rivers and potential landslides.

Additionally, Typhoon No. 10 is projected to approach western and eastern Japan starting on August 27th, likely maintaining its strength as it moves through the area. Residents are warned to prepare for severe weather conditions, including heavy rain, in the days leading up to the typhoon's arrival.

On a related note, the Ministry of the Environment is considering a pilot study on the health impacts of mercury exposure related to Minamata disease. This follows Environment Minister Ito's announcement in July that such a study would begin within two years, with the ministry now planning to conduct a small-scale trial survey in fiscal year 2025.

Lastly, in Tochigi, the Nikko City Fire Department has restored its emergency 119 service after a malfunction that left the line inoperable for about five hours on August 24th. The service was fully operational again by late evening. And now for the weather. Today in Tokyo, expect a warm day with a high of 32 degrees Celsius, a low of 26 degrees, and partly cloudy skies with a chance of rain later.
