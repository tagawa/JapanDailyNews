### Transcript

Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on June 10th, 2023. The Dentsu Group, involved in the bid-rigging scandal surrounding the Tokyo Olympics and Paralympics, has released a report by external experts pointing out an overly customer-oriented organizational culture and a lack of sensitivity to legal compliance, and calling for strengthened risk management. An 88-year-old man driving a car in the opposite direction crashed into a line of cars waiting at a traffic light in Yamatotakada, Nara, killing a 90-year-old woman who was in the car that was hit. The rainy season front is becoming active, with heavy rain falling in some areas and the risk of landslides increasing due to loosening ground caused by previous rain. The Broadcasting Ethics and Program Improvement Organization (BPO) has decided to review whether there were any ethical problems in the way NHK's news program, News Watch 9, reported on the death of a person who died after receiving a vaccine. A group of medical professionals has found that at least 85 cases have been confirmed in healthcare settings where the My Number Card integrated with the health insurance card, called the My Na Insurance Card, was linked to someone else's information. The Securities and Exchange Surveillance Commission has recommended that the Financial Services Agency take administrative action against three companies, including Chiba Bank and Musashino Bank, for selling financial products known as structured bonds without fully explaining the risks to customers. Tokyo Disneyland's railroad attraction, the Mississippi River, has been operating for 19 days with an expired boiler performance inspection period, and the operating company says it was unaware of the deadline and will work to prevent it from happening again. In May, earthquakes occurred frequently in various parts of Japan, including a strong earthquake with a seismic intensity of 6 in the Noto Peninsula. We investigated why earthquakes seem to be more frequent than usual and their relationship with the expected giant earthquake. And now for the weather. Today in Tokyo, it will be mostly cloudy with a high of 22 degrees Celsius and a low of 20 degrees Celsius. There is a chance of light rain showers throughout the day with a UV index of 5.  And that's all for today's news. Thanks for listening to Japan Daily News.
