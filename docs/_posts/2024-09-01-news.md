Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on September 1st, 2024. Today, we begin with the ongoing impact of Typhoon 10, which has been causing significant disruptions across various transportation systems. Since early this morning, operations on the JR Sobu Line between Asahi and Matsukishi in Chiba Prefecture have been suspended due to fallen trees. The typhoon has also affected the Shinkansen, other JR services, and air travel, leading to delays and cancellations. 

In addition to transportation woes, the Japan Meteorological Agency has issued warnings regarding the potential for extremely heavy rainfall in the Tokai, Kinki, and Kanto regions due to the unstable atmospheric conditions brought on by Typhoon 10. The agency is urging residents to remain vigilant about possible landslides, flooding in low-lying areas, and river overflows, especially since the ground in these regions has already been weakened by previous rainfall. 

In Mie Prefecture, the town of Odaigawa has shifted from an emergency safety measure to an evacuation order for 121 residents in the Otani district, as the Otani River is at risk of overflowing. This evacuation order covers a total of over 8,200 residents across the town, highlighting the seriousness of the situation.

Experts are advising people to focus on the latest information relevant to their local areas rather than just the typhoon's position or strength. Professor Motoyuki Ushiyama from Shizuoka University emphasizes the importance of staying informed about local warnings and taking appropriate evacuation actions.

In other news, a tragic incident occurred in Yokohama on the evening of August 31. A 17-year-old high school girl jumped from a commercial facility connected to JR Yokohama Station, tragically landing on a 32-year-old woman walking below. Both individuals were confirmed dead, and police are currently investigating the circumstances surrounding this heartbreaking event. And now for the weather. Today in Tokyo, expect light rain with temperatures around 30 degrees Celsius, and the humidity will be high at 83 percent.
