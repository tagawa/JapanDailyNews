Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on January 7th, 2024. In today's news, a snowstorm in Ishikawa Prefecture has led to the closure of several roads. The heavy snowfall has made driving conditions dangerous, and authorities have advised people to stay off the roads if possible. This has caused significant disruptions to transportation in the region.

In other news, the Noto Peninsula earthquake has been designated as a 'serious disaster' by the government. The earthquake, which struck earlier this week, has caused widespread damage and the government is now conducting a thorough assessment of the extent of the destruction. Financial support will be provided to aid in the recovery efforts in the affected areas.

Moving on to Tokyo, Governor Koike has announced the decision to make high school and public university tuition effectively free starting from the next academic year. The income restrictions for tuition support will be lifted, allowing more students to pursue higher education without the burden of tuition fees.

In the world of sports, Shogi player Sota Fujii, who holds all eight major titles, is set to defend his first title of the year in the Osho Tournament. The upcoming year will be crucial for Fujii as he aims to maintain his unprecedented eight-title reign.

Back to the Noto Peninsula earthquake, the affected areas are now facing the possibility of heavy snowfall, even in low-lying regions. The cold air mass above is expected to turn rain into snow, leading to significant snow accumulation from today until tomorrow. Residents are advised to be cautious of the impact on transportation, such as icy road conditions, and to be prepared for potential avalanches and freezing temperatures. Additionally, as seismic activity remains active, it is important to remain vigilant for potential aftershocks.

In other news, the parents of a university student who lost his life in a ski tour bus accident in Karuizawa, Nagano Prefecture, eight years ago visited his grave to pray for the prevention of future accidents. The tragic incident claimed the lives of 15 people, and the parents hope that their visit will serve as a reminder of the importance of safety measures in order to avoid similar tragedies.

Lastly, the impact of the earthquake on the lifelines in the Noto region continues to persist. Water supply and power outages are ongoing in various areas. Efforts are being made to provide support and updates on the current situation. We will keep you informed as more information becomes available. And now for the weather. Today in Tokyo, the weather will be partly cloudy with a maximum temperature of 10°C and a minimum temperature of 8°C. There is a 91% chance of dry weather and an 88% chance of sunshine. The UV index is 2.  Visit JapanDailyNews.com for the news, yen exchange rates, and a daily Japanese proverb.
