Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on November 9th, 2023. In recent news, the issue of bear attacks in urban areas has led to the governor of Toyama Prefecture, Mr. Nitta, meeting with Environment Minister Ito to request financial support for local governments involved in capturing the bears.

Moving on to our next story, 25 Japanese individuals linked to a scam group based in Cambodia have been arrested. The suspects have revealed that they were confined to their apartment for 10 hours every day, with limited access to the outside world. The police believe that the group made fraudulent phone calls to Japan while under these restrictions, and are now working to uncover the full extent of their activities.

Shifting our focus, the Tokyo Metropolitan Government has issued a new directive to Takayama Hospital following a case of nurse violence against a patient. The government has expressed dissatisfaction with the hospital's efforts to prevent a recurrence of such incidents and has called for more effective measures.

In other news, a 28-year-old defendant, who was previously charged with attempted fraud using the bankbook of an 85-year-old woman who was later found murdered in her home in Ina City, Nagano Prefecture, has now been arrested on suspicion of robbery and murder.

Moving on, a 37-year-old company employee has been arrested on suspicion of fraud after allegedly stealing a flute from a musical instrument rental store in Shinjuku, Tokyo. The police suspect that the suspect had been using a similar method to deceive customers and had sold approximately 10 million yen worth of musical instruments to a purchasing store.

In a tragic incident, a university student is believed to have been killed by a bear in Hokkaido's Fukushima Town. Experts and authorities are currently conducting investigations to determine the cause of the attack and whether the deceased bear found nearby is the same individual responsible.

Shifting gears, with the ongoing influenza outbreak, doctors in Chiba Prefecture are urging pregnant women to get vaccinated. They emphasize that pregnant women are more likely to experience severe symptoms if infected with the flu.

That's all for today's news. Thank you for tuning in to Japan Daily News. And now for the weather. Today in Tokyo, the weather will be mostly clear with a high of 20°C and a low of 17°C.  Visit JapanDailyNews.com for the news, yen exchange rates, and a daily Japanese proverb.
