Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on August 19th, 2024. In today's news, the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department is investigating an act of vandalism at the entrance of Yasukuni Shrine in Chiyoda Ward. The stone pillar at the shrine's entrance was found defaced with what appears to be black felt pen markings. The police are treating this incident as an act of property damage.

In response to a series of fraudulent insurance claims, including those by the former Big Motor company, the Financial Services Agency has decided to revise the supervisory guidelines for the insurance industry. The agency aims to restore trust in the industry and address the ongoing issues.

As we experience another scorching day, it is important to remain cautious due to unstable atmospheric conditions. Western and eastern Japan will continue to face intense heat, while the atmosphere remains highly unstable, resulting in the possibility of heavy rainfall, flooding of low-lying areas, landslides, lightning strikes, and strong gusts of wind, including tornadoes.

A magnitude 4 earthquake was recorded in Hitachi, Ibaraki Prefecture, early this morning. The Japan Meteorological Agency has advised residents to remain alert for similar earthquakes with similar intensity for the next week, but no tsunami warnings have been issued.

Typhoon 9 has formed near Miyakojima and is expected to move northward through the East China Sea. The Japan Meteorological Agency urges everyone to stay updated on the latest information.

The closure of the Joban Expressway, which was caused by the earthquake, has been lifted. NEXCO East Japan announced that the section between Hitachi Minami-Ota Interchange in Hitachi City and Kitabaraki Interchange in Kitaibaraki City was closed due to the earthquake at 12:50 am, but it was reopened at 3:40 am.

That's all for today's news. Stay tuned for more updates from Japan Daily News. And now for the weather. Today in Tokyo, the weather will be partly cloudy with a high of 32°C and a low of 28°C. There is a chance of rain in the afternoon.  Visit JapanDailyNews.com for the news, yen exchange rates, and a daily Japanese proverb.
