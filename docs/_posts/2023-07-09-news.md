### Transcript

Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on July 9th, 2023. In today's news, several rivers in Hiroshima and Yamaguchi Prefectures have reached dangerous levels. The Inonogawa River in Hiroshima's Higashihiroshima City has fallen below the flood danger level at the Shibaira Observatory. Similarly, the Aridagawa River in Hiroshima's Fukuyama City has also fallen below the flood danger level at the Fukuda Observatory. On the other hand, the Aridagawa River has reached the extremely high flood danger level at the Fukuda Observatory, posing a significant risk of flooding. Meanwhile, in Yamaguchi Prefecture, the Tomodagawa River in Shimonoseki City has reached the flood danger level at the Tomoda Observatory. Additionally, the Gochogawa River in Hiroshima's Onomichi City has reached the extremely high flood danger level at the Marumondeta Observatory. These heavy rains are a result of the active front, which has been causing intermittent heavy rainfall in Kyushu and Chugoku regions. The loose ground and increased risk of landslides have raised concerns for potential disasters. The front is expected to linger until the 11th, and there is a possibility of prolonged heavy rainfall. Please stay cautious of the rainfall patterns and continue to prioritize your safety by staying in secure locations. And now for the weather. The weather in Tokyo today will be cloudy with a maximum temperature of 26°C and a minimum temperature of 25°C.  And that's all for today's news. Thanks for listening to Japan Daily News.
