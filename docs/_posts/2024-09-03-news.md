Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on September 3rd, 2024. In today's news, we begin with severe weather alerts in the Kanto region. Heavy rain and thunderstorms are expected due to a front that has moved into the area. The Japan Meteorological Agency has issued warnings for potential landslides and flooding, urging residents to be cautious as unstable atmospheric conditions are predicted to persist through tomorrow. In response to the heavy rain warnings, both Minamiboso City and Tateyama City in Chiba have issued evacuation advisories for elderly residents and those with disabilities, encouraging them to seek shelter as the situation develops.

Switching gears, a recent survey by the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare has revealed that Japan's smoking rate has dropped to a record low of 14.8 percent, the lowest since tracking began in 2003. This decline is attributed to stricter regulations on indoor smoking, and the ministry plans to enhance support for those looking to quit smoking.

In other news, the issue of aging infrastructure has come to the forefront, with reports indicating that approximately 10,000 bridges across the country are in need of repair or removal within the next five years. Alarmingly, no action has been taken on these structures, raising concerns about public safety as many are managed by local governments.

On a different note, law enforcement has apprehended a 64-year-old suspect in Toyama who was wanted for a robbery incident. The individual allegedly forced a woman in her seventies to drive her own car before stealing it in a parking lot. The suspect was captured last night in Toyama City.

Finally, this summer has been recorded as one of the hottest on record, with average temperatures exceeding normal levels by 1.76 degrees Celsius. The Japan Meteorological Agency notes that this summer's heat has tied with last year for the highest since records began in 1898, prompting discussions about the implications of rising temperatures. And now for the weather. Today in Tokyo, expect a warm day with a high of 28 degrees Celsius, a low of 24 degrees, and light rain showers throughout the day.
