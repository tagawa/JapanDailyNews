Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on August 9th, 2023. In our top news stories today, Nagasaki Prefecture has issued evacuation orders to 1,202 households and 2,212 people in the town of Ojika due to the approaching typhoon. The evacuation order is at Level 4, urging everyone to evacuate from dangerous areas.

Moving on to weather news, Typhoon No. 7 is expected to approach the Ogasawara Islands around Saturday. The typhoon is currently moving westward near the Ogasawara Sea and is forecasted to bring strong winds and stormy conditions. Residents are advised to prepare early and stay updated with the latest information.

In other news related to the typhoons, Typhoon No. 6 has been causing widespread impact across various regions. The slow-moving typhoon has brought record-breaking heavy rainfall, with some areas in Miyazaki Prefecture receiving over 600 millimeters of rain, surpassing the average rainfall for the entire month of August. The Japan Meteorological Agency has issued warnings for potential landslides, flooding in low-lying areas, river flooding, and strong winds in Kyushu and Amami regions.

Meanwhile, a convenience store in Adachi Ward, Tokyo, was targeted by a man armed with a knife. The man entered the store during the early hours of the morning and attacked two employees before fleeing the scene without taking anything. The victims sustained serious injuries to their backs and arms, and the police are investigating the incident as attempted murder.

Today marks the 78th anniversary of the atomic bombing of Nagasaki. Despite the approaching typhoon, a scaled-down peace memorial ceremony will be held in Nagasaki. As Russia continues its military aggression in Ukraine and nuclear threats, Nagasaki sends a message of determination towards nuclear disarmament and aims to be the last place to suffer from a nuclear attack. And now for the weather. Today in Tokyo, there will be moderate to heavy rain showers with a high of 29°C and a low of 28°C.  And that's all for today's news. Thanks for listening to Japan Daily News.
