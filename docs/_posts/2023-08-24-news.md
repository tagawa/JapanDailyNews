### Transcript

Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on August 24th, 2023. In today's news, Shizuoka Prefecture has issued an evacuation advisory due to heavy rain and the risk of flooding. The wet air flowing in from the south has caused rain clouds to develop, leading to increased rainfall accompanied by thunderstorms. As a precautionary measure, the city of Hamamatsu in Shizuoka Prefecture has issued an evacuation advisory for certain areas in the middle, west, and south districts, affecting 18,889 households and 42,634 people, particularly the elderly and those with physical disabilities.

In other news, Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO) plans to release treated water into the sea from the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant. The water will be diluted before the release, and the government and TEPCO have taken measures to address concerns and seek understanding from domestic and international stakeholders, including fishermen.

Moving on, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare has established a new specialized department to support companies facing labor shortages. The ministry aims to enhance measures to address the shortage of workers by expanding the functions of Hello Work, a public employment service agency.

The government's budget request for the fiscal year 2023 is expected to exceed 110 trillion yen for the third consecutive year. This increase is attributed to the strengthening of defense capabilities, resulting in higher defense spending, as well as the rising long-term interest rates, which will lead to increased interest payments on government bonds.

In an update on North Korea, a ballistic missile using North Korea's missile technology was launched early this morning. The missile separated into multiple parts and fell into three areas outside Japan's exclusive economic zone (EEZ). The Ministry of Defense has confirmed that the satellite was not successfully placed into orbit, indicating a failed launch attempt. We will continue to provide updates as more information becomes available.

As for the weather, today is expected to be dangerously hot in various parts of Japan, particularly in Niigata and Fukushima prefectures. It is crucial to take measures to prevent heatstroke. Additionally, due to the influence of moist air, a wide area from western to northern Japan is forecasted to experience unstable atmospheric conditions, including sudden heavy rain, lightning, and strong gusts of wind, such as tornadoes. Please exercise caution and stay safe.

Lastly, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs plans to strengthen measures against misinformation and enhance strategic communication in response to the circulation of false information regarding the treated water from the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant. The ministry aims to include approximately 70 billion yen in the budget request for the next fiscal year to support these efforts. And now for the weather. Today in Tokyo, the weather will be mostly cloudy with a high of 28°C and a chance of rain showers.  And that's all for today's news. Thanks for listening to Japan Daily News.
