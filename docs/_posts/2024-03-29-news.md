Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on March 29th, 2024. In today's news, we have two significant stories to cover.

First, the job openings ratio for the month of February has decreased nationwide. The average job openings ratio in February was 1.26, which is 0.01 points lower than the previous month. In Ishikawa Prefecture, which was affected by the Noto Peninsula earthquake, the job openings ratio has decreased to 1.41 from the previous month.

Moving on to our second story, the Tokyo Bay Aqua Line has been closed due to strong winds. According to the Japan Road Traffic Information Center, the downline section of the Aqua Line, from Kawasaki-Ukishima Junction in Kanagawa Prefecture to Kisarazu-Kaneda Interchange in Chiba Prefecture, and the upline section, including the Aqua Line Connector Road, between Sodegaura Interchange and Kawasaki-Ukishima Junction in Chiba Prefecture, have been closed since around 8 a.m. due to strong winds.

In other news, the Chiba Prefectural Board of Education has introduced a new system to support university and junior college students who aspire to become teachers. Under this system, the board will fully cover the repayment of scholarships for students who are hired as teachers. This is the first support system of its kind in the country.

The logistics industry is facing a challenge known as the '2024 Problem,' and the Tokyo Metropolitan Government is taking steps to promote efficient transportation, including the promotion of 'porch delivery' to reduce redelivery. This initiative aims to address the issues arising from the increase in online shopping and the subsequent increase in delivery demands.

In an effort to support farmers and fishermen affected by the Noto Peninsula earthquake, an event was held in Hakusan City, Ishikawa Prefecture, where dishes made from local ingredients were served, and a portion of the proceeds was donated.

The Tohoku Shinkansen between Tokyo and Sendai has temporarily suspended operations due to a power outage between Omiya Station in Saitama Prefecture and Oyama Station in Tochigi Prefecture. At the moment, there is no estimated time for the resumption of services.

Lastly, the Japan Meteorological Agency has issued warnings for strong winds and heavy rain in northern and eastern Japan. The agency urges caution against strong winds and high waves, as well as the potential for landslides and flooding in low-lying areas along the Pacific coast.

That concludes today's news. Thank you for listening to Japan Daily News. Stay tuned for more updates. And now for the weather. Today in Tokyo, the weather will be mostly cloudy with light rain in the morning and moderate rain in the afternoon. The temperature will range from 13°C to 18°C.
