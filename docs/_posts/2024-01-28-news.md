Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on January 28th, 2024. In today's news, we have three significant stories from Japan.

First, the use of Automated External Defibrillators, or AEDs, has proven to be a life-saving measure. AEDs are medical devices that deliver an electric shock to individuals experiencing cardiac arrest, such as a heart attack. This year marks the 20th anniversary of AEDs being made available to the general public. According to a report by a group of doctors and experts, over 7,000 people have been saved by AEDs so far.

Moving on to our next story, a new fault line has been discovered in Shiga, a town in Ishikawa Prefecture. This discovery comes after the Noto Peninsula earthquake, which caused a magnitude 7 tremor in Shiga. The newly found fault line is different from the active fault line that caused the major earthquake. Although the two fault lines are approximately 20 kilometers apart, experts believe they moved almost simultaneously. This finding is crucial for future disaster prevention and has been described as an important discovery.

In weather news, the rain and snowfall continue to affect the areas affected by the Noto Peninsula earthquake. Today, there is a forecast of intermittent rain and snow, increasing the risk of landslides. It is essential to remain cautious and take measures to prevent hypothermia and economy class syndrome to avoid disaster-related deaths. Additionally, seismic activity remains active, and the Japan Meteorological Agency advises everyone to be alert for strong earthquakes.

That concludes today's news update from Japan Daily News. Stay tuned for more updates on Japan's current events. And now for the weather. Today in Tokyo, the weather will be partly cloudy with a maximum temperature of 10°C and a minimum temperature of 5°C.
