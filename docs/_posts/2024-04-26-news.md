Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on April 26th, 2024. In today's news, Princess Kako, the second daughter of Prince and Princess Akishino, will embark on an official visit to Greece, marking the 125th anniversary of diplomatic relations between Japan and Greece. The visit is scheduled to take place from May 25th to June 1st.

Moving on to local news, the Tokyo Metro Ginza Line has resumed full service after a temporary suspension between Asakusa and Mitsukoshimae stations due to a malfunction in the safety equipment at Ueno Station. The suspension was lifted at around 8:07 am.

In other news, two individuals, including the president of a company in Chiba Prefecture, have been arrested for illegally selling a cryptocurrency called '8Coin' without proper registration. The Hokkaido police suspect that the two individuals have illegally sold cryptocurrency worth at least several hundred million yen to customers nationwide.

Turning to international news, two ships from the Chinese Coast Guard have once again entered Japanese territorial waters near the Senkaku Islands in Okinawa. The vessels entered the waters at around 3 am on the 26th, prompting the Japan Coast Guard to issue warnings and ensure the safety of Japanese ships in the area.

In an effort to strengthen support for individuals who experience social withdrawal, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare has announced plans to create a handbook for local government officials. The handbook will provide guidance on supporting the estimated 1.4 million individuals in Japan who are socially withdrawn.

Tragedy struck in Tokushima Prefecture as three out of four individuals, all 18 years old, lost their lives when the compact car they were traveling in crashed through a guardrail and plunged into a rice paddy. The police are currently investigating the circumstances surrounding the incident.

Lastly, a revised bill regarding the 'Crime Victims' Compensation' has been finalized. While victim support groups have praised the increase in minimum compensation, they have also pointed out issues such as the exclusion of past crime victims from eligibility. The bill aims to enhance economic compensation for the families of crime victims.

That's all for today's news. Thank you for listening to Japan Daily News. And now for the weather. Today in Tokyo, the weather will be partly cloudy with a maximum temperature of 24°C and a minimum temperature of 17°C.
