Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on April 24th, 2024. In the aftermath of a magnitude 6.0 earthquake that struck Ehime and Kochi prefectures a week ago, experts are urging for seismic reinforcement measures to be implemented. The quake resulted in 14 injuries and caused damage to homes, including collapsed walls, in various areas of the two prefectures and Oita prefecture. Experts are pointing out the need for seismic reinforcement as a preparation for potential future earthquakes, such as the Nankai Trough megaquake.

In a disturbing case in Nasu, Tochigi prefecture, the investigation into the disposal of burned bodies has revealed bloodstains belonging to the female victim in the trunk and backseat of the suspect's car. Police suspect that the two victims were subjected to assault before being transported in the car and abandoned at the scene. Authorities, including the Metropolitan Police Department, are conducting further investigations to uncover the details.

In the aftermath of the devastating earthquake in Suzu City, a volunteer was able to recover a precious item from the rubble of a collapsed home. Although the time for displaying it has passed, the discovery of this 'treasure' has brought a glimmer of hope.

Analyzing the data from the earthquake that struck Ehime and Kochi prefectures on April 17th, experts have found that the areas with the strongest shaking were more prone to shorter-period tremors, lasting less than one second. These short-period tremors, which are more likely to cause damage to roof tiles and other structures, were more prevalent in the heavily affected regions.

The implementation of the 'Heatstroke Special Alert,' which is announced when there is a risk of serious health damage due to anticipated high temperatures, has begun on April 24th.

Experts investigating the earthquake that registered a magnitude 6.0 in Kochi prefecture's Sukumo City a week ago have discovered that the damage is concentrated in areas with weak ground foundations.

Opposition groups have held a rally on April 23rd, demanding the abandonment of the proposed revision to the civil law, which includes the introduction of 'joint custody' after divorce, allowing both parents to have custody of their children. And now for the weather. Today in Tokyo, there will be overcast skies with a high of 15°C and a low of 14°C. There is a 93% chance of dry weather, but a 100% chance of light drizzle in the afternoon. The visibility will be reduced to 2 kilometers. Overall, it will be a cloudy and slightly rainy day.  Visit JapanDailyNews.com for the news, yen exchange rates, and a daily Japanese proverb.
