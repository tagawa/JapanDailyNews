Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on January 20th, 2024. In today's news, we start with the aftermath of the Noto Peninsula Earthquake. The areas affected by the earthquake are expected to experience rainfall starting this afternoon. Due to the intense shaking, there is a risk of landslides even with minimal rainfall, so residents are advised to be cautious. Moving on to weather news, the Kanto and Koshin regions will see snow and rain from this afternoon, with heavy snowfall expected in mountainous areas from tonight until tomorrow. The Japan Meteorological Agency has issued a warning for potential transportation disruptions and icy road conditions. Shifting our focus to the impact of the Noto Peninsula Earthquake on transportation, as of 5 a.m. today, there have been reports of disruptions to railways, aviation, and roads. Turning to the voices from the affected areas, a father in one collapsed building expressed his disbelief and sorrow, unable to accept the reality of losing his loved ones. Many others have also lost their family members in this earthquake. In other news, the Noto Peninsula Earthquake has led to approximately 26,000 cancellations at accommodation facilities in Ishikawa Prefecture, particularly in the southern Kaga region.
