Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on February 3rd, 2024. In Nagano, a search has begun for three individuals who went off-track while snowboarding and skiing in the mountains of Nozawa Onsen Village. The police and other authorities have been conducting the search since the morning of the 3rd.

In Miyagi, a high school in Minamisanriku has created messages of support for students from Ishikawa Prefecture who have been facing challenges due to the Noto Peninsula earthquake. The messages include heartfelt notes and videos.

Moving on to another news story, a suspect who was arrested in connection with an attempted murder case in Nagano is now being investigated for involvement in a murder case in Mito City, Ibaraki Prefecture. The Ibaraki Prefectural Police suspect that the arrested gang member was involved in the murder of another gang member in Mito City back in 2022.

In Ishikawa, the traditional event called 'Amamehagi,' which is held every year on Setsubun for warding off evil spirits, will not take place in some areas this year due to the earthquake damage.

Staying in Ishikawa, the prefecture will be dispatching volunteers to Suzu City and Nakunoto Town starting from today to assist with the cleanup of disaster waste in the areas affected by the Noto Peninsula earthquake.

In an effort to strengthen relations with Pacific island countries, the Japan Coast Guard has dispatched maritime safety officers to Micronesia and the Marshall Islands for the first time. The officers conducted rescue training exercises as part of the cooperation initiative.

And finally, here is the information regarding water supply support in Ishikawa Prefecture for today, which includes the regions of Wajima, Suzu, and Nakunoto Town. And now for the weather. Today in Tokyo, the weather will be partly cloudy with a high of 9°C and a low of 4°C.  Visit JapanDailyNews.com for the news, yen exchange rates, and a daily Japanese proverb.
