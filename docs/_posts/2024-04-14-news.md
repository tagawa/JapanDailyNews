Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on April 14th, 2024. In today's news, we have two significant stories to discuss.

First, in a gold teacup theft case at a department store in Nihonbashi, Tokyo, the suspect who was arrested is believed to have brought the teacup to a buying store in the Koto ward on the day of the incident and sold it for approximately 1.8 million yen. The teacup, worth around 10 million yen, has not been found yet, raising the possibility that it has been further sold. The Metropolitan Police Department is conducting a detailed investigation.

Moving on to our second story, it has been eight years since the Kumamoto earthquake, which claimed the lives of 276 people, including earthquake-related deaths. Recently, it was revealed that two elderly individuals in their 70s living alone in public housing for disaster victims in Kumamoto Prefecture had died in isolation during the 2023 fiscal year. This highlights the challenge of supporting the lives of earthquake survivors in their new homes.

Next, a fire broke out at a temporary lodging facility in Kawasaki, resulting in the deaths of two men in their 60s and 50s, and three people were injured. The police and fire department are investigating the exact cause of the fire.

In another update on the gold teacup theft case, the Tokyo Metropolitan Police arrested a 32-year-old suspect on the 13th of this month.

Looking ahead, we are now just one year away from the opening of the Osaka-Kansai Expo. The focus will not only be on the construction of the venue and preparations for its operation but also on how to generate nationwide interest.

Furthermore, the Sanriku Railway, which suffered significant damage in the Great East Japan Earthquake and tsunami, celebrated its 40th anniversary since its establishment this month. A commemorative ceremony was held on the 13th.

Lastly, in Rausu, Ishikawa Prefecture, tulips are blooming in the burnt remains of the 'Asaichi Street,' which was heavily damaged in the Noto Peninsula earthquake and subsequent fire. For the woman who lost her home in the fire, this serves as a symbol of hope and moving forward from the disaster.

That's all for today's news. Thank you for listening to Japan Daily News. And now for the weather. Today in Tokyo, the weather will be sunny with a high of 22°C and a low of 15°C.  Visit JapanDailyNews.com for the news, yen exchange rates, and a daily Japanese proverb.
