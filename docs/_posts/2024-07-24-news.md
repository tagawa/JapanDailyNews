Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on July 24th, 2024. Today's news from Japan:

First, a powerful typhoon, Typhoon No. 3, is expected to approach the Okinawa Islands this afternoon. The Yaeyama and Miyako regions are at high risk of severe weather conditions such as strong winds, high tides, landslides, and flooding. The Meteorological Agency is urging residents to take strict precautions.

In Hokkaido, the town of Aibetsu has issued evacuation orders to 122 households and 239 people due to the risk of flooding caused by heavy rain. The town has opened a comprehensive center as an evacuation shelter.

In other news, a 48-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after allegedly attacking his wife with a knife in a hospital in Sagamihara. The woman suffered minor injuries, and the suspect has partially denied the allegations.

As for the weather, extreme heat continues to grip eastern and western Japan, with Shizuoka Prefecture expecting temperatures of up to 38 degrees Celsius today. Authorities are urging people to avoid outdoor activities and take measures to prevent heatstroke.

In addition, heavy rain is forecasted for northern Japan, particularly in the evening and overnight. There is also a possibility of heavy rain in Okinawa due to the approaching typhoon. The Meteorological Agency is warning of the risk of landslides, flooding, and river overflow.

Furthermore, there were technical difficulties with commercial broadcasts on TV Asahi last night, resulting in the interruption of commercials on both TV Asahi and BS Asahi. The cause of the problem is currently under investigation.

Lastly, in an investment fraud case involving social media, two groups based in Osaka have been arrested for deceiving people into purchasing investment products and swindling them out of cash. During the investigation, more than 1800 smartphones and manuals were confiscated. The police suspect that the groups used fake identities, including young women, to communicate with victims. The investigation is ongoing. And now for the weather. Today in Tokyo, the weather will be mostly sunny with a high of 33°C and a low of 29°C. There is a slight chance of rain in the afternoon.
