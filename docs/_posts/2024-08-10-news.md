Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on August 10th, 2024. In today's news, the Japan Meteorological Agency has issued a temporary warning for a possible major earthquake in the Nankai Trough seismic zone. Following a magnitude 7.1 earthquake with a weak intensity of 6 in Miyazaki Prefecture on the 8th, the agency has raised concerns about an increased likelihood of a large-scale earthquake in the Nankai Trough seismic zone. They urge continued vigilance and caution. No significant changes in strain have been observed so far, but monitoring efforts are ongoing.

In other news, train services on the JR Chuo and Sobu lines have resumed. Due to a personal accident at Akihabara Station, train operations between Ochanomizu Station and Nishi-Funabashi Station were suspended. However, as of 7:04 a.m., all train services have resumed.

Moving on, Typhoon No. 5 is expected to approach and make landfall in northern Japan around the 12th of this month. The typhoon is currently moving northward over the eastern waters of Japan, maintaining its strong winds. Residents are advised to stay updated on the latest information and make necessary preparations before the strong winds and heavy rains arrive.

Additionally, a magnitude 5.1 earthquake was felt in Kanagawa Prefecture, with widespread intensities of 4 and 3 observed in the Kanto-Koshin region. Despite the temporary warning issued for the Nankai Trough mega-earthquake, experts believe that this earthquake is unrelated. The Japan Meteorological Agency is calling for caution against earthquakes of similar intensity for the next week.

In other news, an event was held in Tokyo where participants could experience simulated nighttime earthquakes to learn how to ensure safety. Families and others attended the event organized by the Tokyo Fire Department to learn about the appropriate responses to secure safety during earthquakes.

Furthermore, today's weather forecast predicts dangerous heat in the Tokai and western regions of Japan. Please continue to take thorough measures to prevent heatstroke.

Lastly, a program was held for students from Asia Women's University, which was established with the aim of supporting women's education in South Asia, and students from the University of Tokyo to discuss social issues. The students presented their findings and achievements in poster format. And now for the weather. Today in Tokyo, the weather will be partly cloudy with a high of 34°C and a low of 28°C. There is a 43% chance of overcast skies. The UV index is 6, indicating moderate sun exposure. No rain is expected. Enjoy your day!
