Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on February 11th, 2024. In today's news, Japan is bracing for unstable weather conditions due to a strong cold air mass. The Japan Meteorological Agency has issued a warning for severe gusts of wind, thunderstorms, and hail in western and eastern Japan on February 12th. Moving on to our next story, the selection process for the final disposal site of high-level radioactive waste, also known as 'nuclear waste,' has made progress. A draft report of a literature survey conducted in two towns in Hokkaido, the first of its kind nationwide, suggests that the entire area of Satsumasendai Town and certain parts of Kamoenai Village, excluding the volcanic zone, could be potential candidates for the next stage of investigation. Now, let's turn our attention to a recent scientific breakthrough. Researchers from the National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences have discovered a gene that affects the development of brain nerve cells and is associated with various mental disorders. This finding provides new insights into the mechanisms behind these conditions. Shifting gears, a tragic accident occurred on the Chita Peninsula Road in Aichi Prefecture. A truck collided with the median and spilled its cargo, including rocks, onto the opposite lane, resulting in the death of a male driver in a passenger car. The police have arrested the truck driver and are investigating the cause and details of the accident. In the aftermath of the Noto Peninsula earthquake, voices of frustration and despair are emerging from the disaster-stricken areas. People are sharing their experiences of being unable to receive help, including the inability to reach emergency medical services and the lack of assistance in evacuation centers. The devastating impact of the earthquake and tsunami has left many grieving and feeling helpless. And in other news, approximately 1,600 households in the Noto region of Ishikawa Prefecture are still experiencing power outages following the recent earthquake. Lastly, during cleanup operations after the earthquake in Nanao City, Ishikawa Prefecture, a man in his 60s was trapped under a collapsed concrete block wall and is currently in critical condition. That's all for today's news. Thank you for listening to Japan Daily News. And now for the weather. Today in Tokyo, the weather will be mostly clear with a high of 9°C and a low of 5°C. There is a 0% chance of rain and a UV index of 3. Enjoy your day!  Visit JapanDailyNews.com for the news, yen exchange rates, and a daily Japanese proverb.
