Hello and welcome to today's news from Japan Daily News on January 9th, 2024. In today's news, JR East Japan has announced changes to its train schedules starting in March. Tokyo-Chiba express trains will now have reserved seating, and free seating will no longer be available on major express trains departing and arriving in Tokyo.

In other news, following the recent earthquake, delivering necessary supplies to isolated areas has become a challenge. However, in Ishikawa Prefecture's Wajima City, a solution was found. On the 8th, medicine was delivered to earthquake victims using drones.

Moving on, after temporarily suspending operations for safety checks at level crossings, the Sotetsu Line has resumed full service. The line had been suspended since 6:40 am, but as of 6:40 am, trains are running again.

Next, a magnitude 7.0 earthquake struck near Indonesia, but the Japan Meteorological Agency has confirmed that there is no tsunami threat to Japan. The agency issued a Northwest Pacific Tsunami Information, warning of possible tsunamis near the epicenter.

Returning to domestic news, the Sotetsu Line was temporarily suspended again due to safety checks at level crossings between Seya Station and Mitsukyo Station. The suspension began at 5:39 am.

In other earthquake-related news, the active seismic activity continues in the Noto region of Ishikawa Prefecture, which experienced a magnitude 7 earthquake. The Japan Meteorological Agency is urging residents to be cautious of strong tremors with a maximum intensity of 5.5 or higher for the next month. In addition, the affected areas are facing severe cold temperatures, and rain is expected later in the day, increasing the risk of hypothermia, landslides, and avalanches.

Lastly, plans to begin the removal of the highly challenging 'nuclear fuel debris' at Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant are facing delays. Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO) had planned to start the experimental removal process in Unit 2 by March this year. However, preparations for inserting a robot arm into the containment vessel have been difficult, and the schedule may need to be revised. And now for the weather. Today in Tokyo, the weather will be mostly clear with a high of 10°C and a low of 4°C. There is a 13% chance of sunshine and a 0% chance of rain. Enjoy your day!
