### What is this?

Encouraged by friends in the [Tokyo Tech](https://tokyotech.com) community, this podcast uses AI to generate natural English summaries of NHK news stories, which are then converted into human-sounding speech. The result is short, easy-to-digest English news updates that are directly from a Japanese source.
