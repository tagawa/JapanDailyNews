## This is the site for **Japan Daily News**

[Japan Daily News](https://japandailynews.com) has been built using Jekyll and GitHub Pages to create individual posts for each episode and power the RSS feed for podcast subscriptions. 

Credit for the site design goes to [Tim Klapdor](https://timklapdor.com/). This site was inspired by Tim's use of the [Jekyll Skeleton](https://github.com/timklapdor/jekyll-skeleton) to create the [LinkRot Podcast](https://github.com/timklapdor/link-rot).

The backend Python script that I run locally to create the daily podcast is here: [github.com/tagawa/AI-Podcast-Creator](https://github.com/tagawa/AI-Podcast-Creator). And I have a video course where I explain how to build it yourself: [ChatGPT-to-Speech: Build an AI-Powered Podcast With Python](https://www.udemy.com/course/ai-chatgpt-to-speech-with-python/?referralCode=6F94B03A927734DA0043)
