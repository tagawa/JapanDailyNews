## This is the site for **Japan Daily News**

[The site](https://japandailynews.com) has been built using Jekyll and GitHub Pages to create individual posts for each episode and power the RSS feed for subscriptions. 

Episodes can be streamed using the [Plyr](https://github.com/Selz/plyr) HTML/JS media player.

All thanks for the site design, and guidance in the development for this site is given to [Tim Klapdor](https://timklapdor.com/). This site was inspired by Tim's use of the [Jekyll Skeleton](https://github.com/timklapdor/jekyll-skeleton) to create the [LinkRot Podcast](https://github.com/timklapdor/link-rot).
