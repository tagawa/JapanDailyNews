# Japan Daily News

A podcast of the latest news from Japan, powered by AI with computer-generated voice.

Encouraged by friends in the [Tokyo Tech](https://tokyotech.com/) community, the [Japan Daily News podcast](https://japandailynews.com) uses AI to generate natural English summaries of NHK news stories, which are then converted into human-sounding speech. The result is short, easy-to-digest English news updates that are directly from a Japanese source.
